I had never heard of it before a friend of mine gave me a piece that he had bought overseas.  Quite simply I was hooked at that exact moment.  Today's candies are too pretensive thinking that they have something new and exciting to offer.  Little do they know that Hi Chew was lying in wait.  The candy has a texture that is hard to describe, but imagine biting into a cloud of semi-hard marshmallows but not overbearing in the sweet department.  You need this candy in your life NOW!"

In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea.<br /><br />Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo's very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe.<br /><br />You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste ..."

Khannah-Brown""",2,2,5,1181692800,Original Idea---Kombucha from a Tea!,"*****<br />This Organic Green Tea Kombucha from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Green Tea Kombucha is based on an ancient remedy and offers a convenient form of Kombucha designed for daily use. Legend has it that some 2,000 years ago, Kombucha originated in Russia, and from there it traveled to Japan. Since then it has been used to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach. This special healing formula is made with  Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis), which is organically grown and, unlike other green teas, has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. Green Tea has excellent antioxidant properties. To it we have added a concentrated purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm), which is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea, and is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs. The recipe is complemented with Organic Spearmint, which can help to relax the body and aid digestion; Organic Licorice Root, to support the adrenals and enhance the effects of other healing herbs; and Dong Quai Root, a well-known tonic. Once the benefits of these ingredients are released by hot water, you are ready to enjoy a delicious, delightful and soothing cup of tea - and one that is naturally rich in antioxidants and other health-supporting qualities.""<br /><br />Yogi Tea's use of ""Kombucha-Pure"", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a decaf version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea is decaffeinated---naturally, of course!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"

That's why I ordered their green decaf. However, this decaf does not have the same qualities as their regular green tea. The tea is not green in color -- it is more of a brownish color -- and it doesn't have that fresh ""green"" taste I enjoy with their caffeinated version.  Maybe green tea just doesn't keep its color or flavor when it is decaffeinated.  It's not too bad though, and I'll have to keep trying it to see if it grows on me.  I actually have not found the perfect green decaf yet.<br /><br />PS: After a long period of thinking I didn't like it, then going back to try it again, it may not be as bad as I first thought.  Most green decafs disappoint, so don't consider any green decafs as having true green tea flavor.  Stash's isn't objectionable like some, it's just bland.  It's a bit better than most green decafs, but not nearly as good as good Japanese caffeinated green tea.  For true green tea taste, try a Japanese Sencha or Macha caffeinated tea, like Kirkland's Signature Macha or Yamamotoyama teas.  I very much DISlike the Stash Organic Premium Decaf Green however, and urge you not to buy it. I have a concern about the levels of fluoride in green teas (especially Chinese teas, so I've read), but I suppose if consumed in moderation, like everything else, the risks shouldn't be of great concern, and the benefits probably outweigh them."

With rare exceptions, Blue Buffalo is the only kibble that I feed to my cats. However, my cats appreciate some variety in canned food so I look around for different quality foods that I can rotate into their feeding regimen. Among the things that I look for in any cat food are primary ingredients consisting of poultry, fish or meat, and an absence of corn, soy, wheat, or gluten of any kind. Two of my cats just turned twenty-two, a third will be twenty-two in a month, and a fourth is ten years of age, so I include canned food in their diet twice a day, to ensure proper hydration. While I rotate between the various Blue Buffalo canned food choices, I add other quality canned food choices to the diet plan, as well. My cats are satisfied with the same kibble day after day, but they get bored with the same canned food more than a couple of days in a row.<br /><br />The Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Feline Formula in Gravy was well received by all four of my cats, and I am very pleased with its ingredients.

I happen to know that there are some pretty bad cat foods on the market that my cats will nevertheless like the taste of, so I don't leave everything up to an animal that is unable to read the ingredient list. The first ingredients are as follows: Salmon, fish broth, chicken broth, chicken liver, chicken, dried egg white, ocean fish, peas, modified potato starch, natural flavor, roasted salmon...<br /><br />I am always curious about listed ingredients such as ""natural flavor"" - natural flavor of what?

Other than that, everything in the ingredient list is recognizable to me as being either a natural food, vitamin, mineral or other necessary ingredient.<br /><br />In summary, the ingredients are very good and my cats like the taste, so Taste of the Wild is a go in this family. It's not the only food that I'll feed them by any means, and Blue Buffalo will continue to be my staple, as far as kibble goes, but Taste of the Wild has earned its place in my canned food rotation."

They taste what they look like - a giant chocolate wafer, have very little sugar and no sugar alcohols either. They have a pure whey protein source, no soy protein in these (I always read the packaging on protein bars and sadly soy protein is very common). Nutritionally they are not too bad at all, they are definitely great for a pre-workout treat. They are fairly high in fat, very low in carbs, and middle of the road protein (for a protein bar).  But the fact that it has 0 sugar alcohol, very low sugar, whey protein instead of soy and taste delicious really does make up for the higher fat content.<br /><br />Now it isn't really a downside but they are dry and make your mouth water a ton - make sure you have something to drink with them. But really these are my favorite protein/energy bars out there."

A particularly infuriating situation is the area under a large spruce tree where I have used various colors of mulch to create a pattern that provides an interesting view from the street.  That is until the rogue cat has dug up the mulch, deposited and burying its waste leaving the mulch and the design completely ruined.  Once the mulch colors have been mixed there is no choice but to remove the entire area and replace it.  An exercise in futility however, as the cat will inevitably do the same in another night or two.<br /><br />I have tried various manufactured and home ""repellents"", none of which so far have been effective.  With the mostly favorable reviews for this product I gave it a try but, to my dismay, I find it necessary to weigh in on the side of those who found this product ineffective.  The very next day after its application, the cat had done its duty and made another mess of my mulch.  Perhaps not enough product, perhaps not spread widely enough, or whatever the reason, I tried again with another, heavier, more complete application.  To no avail, however, as not only did the cat return and make an even bigger mess this time, there was evidence of a squirrel having dug through the mulch looking for buried nuts as evidenced by its tell-tale holes in the ground.<br /><br />So, for whatever the reason may be - this is an older cat with a poor sense of smell, etc., this product did not perform as advertised.  While it may work in some situations, it did not in this case.  I can not recommend this product as it seems to be a hit-or-miss outcome and unless there's a better performance record proven for it, I can not see spending the money for a product of doubtful usefullness."

I think they are a bit sweeter than regular Cadbury milk chocolate bars(but those are already pretty sweet too, so am not sure), and even though I like the texture, it's not worth it to pay so much for them.

You don't get as much tea for the money with this one as the less expensive brands, and I find the flavor to be too subtle.  But after reading about the potential dangers of fluoride in green teas, especially the non-organic and Chinese varieties, I will try to stay with this kind, which is said to have a lower level of the carcinogen.  The Tazo China Green Tips green tea has a stronger flavor I prefer, but is said to have a high(er) level of fluoride.  I figure going organic AND Japanese Sencha will reduce my exposure to a degree.  The plastic cover on each teabag is hard to tear without also ripping the delicate bag inside.  Perhaps they should look at the way other brands encase their bags.  The company could reduce the amount of packaging as well by reducing the size of the outer box, which is bigger than it really needs to be.<br /><br />Addendum: After a couple of months of trying this tea, I've knocked off two stars.  I find this one just lacks flavor, and I've wasted about a half-dozen bags that tore open while I tried to open the wrapper, no matter how careful I was.  You should be able to tear open the wrappers, but even if I cut them open, some bags were adhered to the inside of their wrapper and tore open when pulled out. The wrappers are tough plastic and the bags are very delicate. And the strings come off easily, especially while steeping in hot water.  We won't be buying it again."

It has an odd flavor to it and I suspect it's because of the fruit powders - I think the tamarind powder gives it the weird flavor/aftertaste.  I think I would like this a lot more if that were absent.<br /><br />I don't know much about Thai cooking but others are saying it doesn't taste like Pad Thai anyway, so removal of what may be a Thai ingredient (tamarind) isn't going to make sales go down.<br /><br />There's still the standard good stuff that stands for most McDougall varieties. You get a lot of it, it's convenient and great to have around at the office for a more healthy-than-the-vending machine snack.

As soon as I got the product, my son and I put together a terrific dish with this! After reading the two recipes on the back, here is what we improvised: Chop up half a small cabbage, an onion, two cloves of garlic, two stalks of celery, a red bell pepper and a few small portabella mushrooms. Saute in about a Tablespoon of olive oil. Soak the noodles for a minute or so. Add the noodles to the mix. Add one small can of chopped anchovies, along with the oil from the can. My son put lots of red pepper (cayenne) in, and I thought it would be too much, but it was actually delicious in it. We had a package of portabella mushroom soup in the fridge, so I added about a third cup of that for flavor and moisture. With this package of Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli, a little imagination we concocted a delicious hot dinner dish. The only thing I would have added if I had some would have been some seafood--such as scallops and/or shrimp. Bits of chicken would have worked nicely, too. It was quite filling and satisying. I will probably get more of this brown rice vermicelli to keep on hand for quick dishes."

There are great coffees in Italy, Kenya, Ethiopia, Colombia, and many other countries, but in the USA there is no finer coffee than French Market Coffee & Chicory. I've been drinking this for over 40 years and it is a staple in my home. It never disappoints, and I always get unsolicited rave reviews from guests about the coffee I brew.<br /><br />There are a couple of things you should know. Even though this is a blend of coffee & chicory, it makes a robust pot of coffee. Pay attention to the advice that's printed on the lid of every can: ""Use 1/3 to 1/2 as much coffee as you would normally use to brew a pot."" My standard recipe these days is 2 level scoops per 8 cups of water for an automatic drip brewer, but if your coffee maker will take 10 or 12 cups of water, I'd still recommend using just 2 level scoops; then adjust to your own taste.<br /><br />You get great value from a can of French Market coffee. The can is 16 oz., not 12 oz. like many other cans on your grocer's shelf. And by using only 2 level scoops per pot, that can will last for weeks.<br /><br />The company that makes French Market coffee was acquired by another New Orleans-based company, but I trust that they will respect the heritage and tradition of this great New Orleans brand. Try French Market coffee and see if you agree with me that it's simply the best."

Product is 100 percent green tripe and nothing else - I noticed that they reduced the price on this product since I placed my last order - much appreciated!  Be warned to keep the bag pointed away from you when opening, otherwise you'll be exposed to the smell......"

Brooks""",5,5,5,1259539200,WAY better than canned (Correct preparation instructions included),"I used to buy this product in bulk from Wild Oats, but haven't been able to find it in several years (Wild Oats was bought out by Whole Foods and the one near me doesn't carry this in bulk). I was so happy to find this product in bulk on Amazon (whether buying 12 7oz. boxes or buying the 3 3.3lb bags which is what I bought). Yes, it's a ton of mix, but I make this so often and it lasts practically forever provided it's kept sealed.<br /><br />The flavor is so far superior to anything canned and, dare I say, even better than refried beans made at home. This is mainly due to the extra flavorings added to the mix whereas home recipes usually only add salt and/or garlic. This product is perfect for anyone who loves refried beans and wants a convenient way to prepare them. I think it's incredible that something this easy and fast to prepare actually tastes better than something you can make at home (that also takes much longer). It's great for quick bean and cheese burritos or breakfast burritos (bean, cheese, and egg with some red sauce) and also great for campers. Plus, if you buy the 3 3.3lb bags, you can divide this product up and make as much or as little as you need.<br /><br />Preparation information:  Many sites I researched for this product said to mix 1.75C boiling water with 1C of mix in a bowl, cover, and let sit for 5 mins.  However, THIS IS INCORRECT and results in runny beans.  I contacted the good folks at Fantastic Foods and was forwarded preparation instructions which are as follows.<br /><br />Pour 1.75C boiling water of 1 1/3C of mix in a bowl.  Stir well, cover and let sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />I haven't tried this ratio yet as I just received the email and wanted to post a review including the instructions since they all seem to be incorrect everywhere I look.  If the beans are still too runny for you, increase to 1.5C of mix and try that.  I personally like my beans very thick for both eating plain and in burritos."
496752,B005HG9ET0,A55LS2HWPQB0Q,"Jill Florio ""Frugal Living writer at Bellaonline""",0,0,5,1346457600,"Delicious, soft water that seems to work well as an unsweetened Gatoraid substitute","When I tasted the Essentia water, I thought it had a smooth, soft taste. Not a crisp water; more earthy and gentle. It is very easy to drink, and tasty.<br /><br />I didn't just want to taste it and review it, though. I put it through its paces. The first thing I did was pick a hot, muggy summer day to test the electrolytes. I spent some time at the beach, in the sun, walking around. While I always love spending time at the beach, I usually get a headache from a combination of sunglare, heat, wind and inadequate hydration. Even if i bring plain water, I tend to get low enough in electrolytes by the end of the day that a minor headache comes on.<br /><br />I kept the Essentia by my side, drank most of the 1.5 liter container, and got through the day and evening comfortably. That is a real plus in my book, since I don't like sweet drinks like Gatoraid or energy sodas. This was a super easy way to drink water and keep my electrolytes up.<br /><br />With the rest of my Essentia, I decided to gather as many waters as I could and do a larger scale taste test. In front of me I have: Essentia, Function (with electrolytes, from CVS), Kirkland (from CostCo), Crystal Geyser (bottled in the Sierras), R/O water from my parent's filtration system, and plain Southern CA tap water.<br /><br />These are all flat waters, not sparkling. They are all at room temperature. The first two are electrolyte waters, and Kirkland's water has added minerals (for taste, the bottle says). And really, those three taste the absolute best. More on those in a minute.<br /><br />The Crystal Geyser water has the least amount of ""taste"" than the other three bottled waters. It is a little...flat? Boring? Staid? This isn't like wine tasting, so I am searching around for the words to describe the different tastes of water. This one just tastes like nothing more than ""wet"".  Arrowhead, which I often drink at home, has this same unexciting non-taste. Not bad, not exceptional.<br /><br />The reverse osmosis filtered water is tastier. It is a step above those forementioned  ""mountain stream"" advertised waters. It is softer and rounder and more enjoyable in the mouth.<br /><br />The tap water is...ok, blech. Don't drink the tap water in So Cal unless you have to. My parents don't even use it in their coffee.<br /><br />Back to the top three waters, Essentia, Function and Kirkland all have added items. The added ""minerals"", in all three cases, are sodium and/or phosphate bicarbonates. Baking soda, mainly. Also magnesium and calcium source minerals. This is interesting, since Kirkland is not advertising their water as an electrolyte replacement fluid. My guess is that Kirland may not have as much electrolyte particulates by volume? Or it could be the same darn thing in each. If anyone wants to call these compankes and find out, I'd love to know.<br /><br />Which of these three top waters tastes the best? Essentia, to my palate. It is almost creamy, very soft, very delicious. I would absolutely switch over to this brand if the price was right. However, if the Kirkland product was much cheaper, I'd stick to that one. It is still delicious. The Function brand is a little less round, somehow. Less zesty, as far as unflavored water can get. :-)<br /><br />I do recommend trying the Essentia, at least to see if you can taste a difference, since I don't think most of us get enough electrolytes in a day. Getting more can only be a good thing, and its easier than messing around with adding baking soda on your own."

I decided to try this when I came across it at the spice place that I was shopping at.  This blend is very zesty, spicy, and remains garlicky even with all the other ingredients.  It's really good, and frankly its the best I have tried in a garlic blend of any kind.  If you like garlic like I do, it's my opinion that you will like this alternative on occasion.  Just remember to use it a little more sparingly than your regular garlic powder.  With the added pepper and other spices, its got a definite punch.  And one last thing, this goes for a couple of dollars cheaper at the spice place online I picked it up at.  However order two or more canisters at once and you get free shipping with Amazon at the time of this writing.  The best deal around considering that.  Recommended for the garlic lovers in your family, who want a little extra punch...  PS:  One more thing I feel I should mention about this blend.  It has a much heavier dose of salt in it than any regular garlic powder, or garlic pepper spice I have used in my opinion.  Tasty as it is, it should be used sparingly, or not at all by those concerned about sodium in their diet.  It's part of what makes the blend so delicious, but not so good for you either..."

I stumbled across PB2 when I was doing some research on a machine called Yonanas, a machine that turns frozen bananas into a creamy tasty soft serve.  I noticed in the machine reviews that some people were mixing chocolate PB2 with frozen bananas in their Yonanas machine.  I had to give this a try!  I ordered a regular PB2 and a chocolate PB2.  I must say that this stuff really really does taste wonderful considering its low calorie count.  I really love PB2.  It is giving me back something I have missed dearly.  The powder is very fine, but mixes pretty well and pretty quick.  I always start with a little less water than the directions say and work up to a little more if needed.

Of course I found it here and decided on the DUCK DUCK GOOSE FREEZE DRIED formula.<br /><br />The patties are actually quite big, and you can add water to reconstitute it or serve it ""as is"" to your pup, and they come in a zip-lock top bag for easy closure and storage.<br /><br />Anyway, I crumbled some of STELLA & CHEWY'S FREEZE DRIED and added it to the Orijen kibble, plus a little warm water. I then gave it to Monju and she sniffed it and began eating like there was no tomorrow! She ate everything in the dish and was licking the bowl after.

The seams in these bags are very weak and, more often than not, split open when you try and pick up the mess left by your pet.  This, unfortunately, can leave you with a handful of poop.

It was fairly easy to steep and produced a dark liquid, even darker than my longest brewed Ceylon tea. I found that steeping for 3 minutes allowed me to get 3 to 4 pots (about 18 oz per pot) of full flavored Pu-erh. It has an excellent earthy taste with a scent that is reminiscent of oak wood and something sweet. I have read some books about tea and watched a couple documentaries that focus on what makes good tea. Some of that literature discusses what characterizes quality Pu-erh tea and this product seems to fit the bill. It's now definitely among my favorite teas, a list that includes Darjeeling and Oolong. The only difficulty I had was breaking apart the cake, which is very hard and held together extremely firmly. I ended up sawing off pieces with a serrated knife - once I got some pieces broken off, some of it would break away and crumble more easily by hand. I expect this cake hardness is common to all Pu-erh teas since the fermentation and cake drying process is the standard for this type of tea."

The food was good, but the coffee was the best coffee I had ever tasted.  It was rich and dark and so incredibly flavorful.  It didn't pack a killer caffeine punch, which is good, because I drank a whole pot by myself.  I love coffee and drink it daily, and I've never found another coffee that came close, except at another Ethiopian restaurant.  It's my understanding that coffee originated in that region, which may have something to do with it.  (If I'm wrong, sorry--I'm not a historian.)<br /><br />While I looked forward to this coffee, I was pretty sure it wouldn't be as good as the coffee in the restaurants, made in the traditional way.  I was right.  Still, this is the best coffee I've had from a coffee pod.<br /><br />It was rich and dark, as I expected.  The scent that was released when I opened the packet was wonderfully deep and complex.  The first cup, made from the pod, was very good, if a little bland.  The smell while it brewed turned a little unpleasant near the end, for some reason, but it faded quickly and wasn't present in the brewed coffee at all.<br /><br />I took out the coffee press for the second cup, and cut open one of the pods.  (I don't recommend this, since the grind is far too fine for a coffee press.)  The coffee made this way was much richer and more complex, and the scent while it brewed was sweet and tempting.  Two cups of this coffee didn't give me caffeine shakes, so caffeine levels seem about average.<br /><br />If it matters to you, this is Fair Trade Certified coffee and some profits are donated to Kicks For Cause Foundation, which supports youth soccer programs."

It has become our go-to seasoning for many things including popcorn!  The small 2.62 oz. shaker from our local store can go as high as $4.00 a container.  Buying this larger size is a little bit cheaper and the convenience of just having it around is cost savings enough.  I would like to bring to everyone's attention you will get this larger container with a white label covering the bar code.  What is also covered is the storage instruction of ""Refrigerate after opening to prolong freshness.""<br />In addition to sprinkling it on popcorn, fresh and raw vegetable salads, pasta salads, we also use it mixed in the flour coating for sauted chicken breasts.  We are still experimenting. The first ingredient is Romano cheese cured with salt.  The next ingredient is salt.  Obviously, if you are on a salt restricted diet this may not be for you.  If you can eat salt, I would suggest moderation.<br />Remember, put into the refrigertor once you open the container and shake before using."

Dent ""Aragorn""",0,0,5,1249344000,A good substitute for real tea when none can be had,"The Green Energy Tea Fusion tea powder allows you to make instant ice green tea wherever you happen to be. All it takes is to fill a bottle with a few ounces of cold water and shake. The end product is a green tea that's honey-lemony tasting, low-calorie and, the maker claims, is made of mostly organic ingredients.<br /><br />Each packet has enough powder to make an okay-tasting 8-16 oz. amount of cool green tea. All you need to do is start with a bottle of cold water, take a sip or 2 to make some room for the shaking that's to follow, drop the powder in, then shake the bottle and... here's your cool green tea. It tastes the way you would expect iced green tea to taste when spiked with a little bit of lemon and honey. The taste, when 16 oz. of water are used is comparable to the gallon-size 'green diet ice tea' containers you could buy from some grocery stores only a little more diluted. When used with only 8 oz. it begins to taste like serious tea but than you'd want a second packet. The powder tea packets give you the ability to make instant green ice tea wherever you are and whenever you feel like without having to carry along a gallon-size canister. In addition, the makers claim that the caffeine and the EGCG (100mg) from one packet are sufficient to 'boost' your metabolism if taken three times daily.<br /><br />As far as contents, the main ingredients listed are: organic Japanese green tea extract, organic Yerba Mat&eacute; extract, organic Guava seeds extract, organic Aloe Vera extract, organic honey crystals and some others.<br /><br />The powder has 23 calories but none of them came from saturated fats or trans fats and none of the sweet taste comes from sugar because no sugar was added.<br /><br />I enjoy drinking this when no better options are available - such as the ability to make 'real' brewed green or, better, white tea. I do not see it as a regular substitute to 'real' tea. Since the product does meet my expectations - produce a reasonably decent drink when nothing better can be had, it gets it's 5 stars and my endorsement (for emergencies only) because I can't think of much that could be done to make it better.<br /><br />__________________________________<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />EGCG also known as Epigallocatechin 3-gallate is a powerful anti-oxidant that can be found in green tea but not in black tea."

The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the ""no mess"" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only ""outside"" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product."

I've had this tea (English Tea Stores brand) and the Teavana brand Gyokuro.  I'd say both are excellent teas.  The Teavana brand is definitely a higher grade tea.  This can mostly be discerned from the slightly more illustrious flavor that the Teavana Gyokuro provides.  Additionally, the English Tea Stores brand tends to be less forgiving of improper brewing temperature - it gets bitter easier.  I noticed that the English Tea Stores brand tended to be a little drier and more brittle.  Teavana gets the tea into your hands while the leaves are still *moist* and in whole strips.  The English Tea Stores Gyokuro was starting to crumble and you will end up with more sediment in your tea.<br /><br />Once we started brewing the English Tea Stores brand Gyokuro in our new Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp 1.7-Liter Stainless-Steel Cordless Electric Kettle, the tea came out acceptably close to Teavana's Gyokuro.  The flavor is outstanding in both cases.  Over time, our purchase of the Electric Kettle will pay for itself because the English Tea Stores brand is much cheaper.  Now we can enjoy the wonderful flavor of Japans greatest tea all the time without emptying our pockets on the best of the best Teavana Gyokuro.  If you do use the Electric Kettle: we use 2 tablespoons of tea (could use less for a milder brew), set the kettle for green tea, put the tea in the water then set a timer for 30 seconds, then remove when the timer goes off.  We also use a cast-iron tea pot that we preheat with a little bit of the water from the kettle, so that might make a difference as well.<br /><br />Overall, this tea is an acceptable replacement to the Teavana brand teas.  If you have the money to buy the tea you want, stick with Teavana.  If you are on a tighter budget, the English Tea Stores is an acceptable trade off if you brew it properly.<br /><br />Ps. The Cuisinart tea pot is AWESOME!<br /><br />- Gyokuro Devotee"

First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers for the chicken dishes, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.

That was the main reason I purchased this box of candy, because I had a good idea of what I was actually buying.  I was also aware that it is a terrible idea to purchase chocolate via mail order during the summer because you will probably end up getting a melted chocolate mess instead of what you wanted.  I thought that it would be ok since I was making this order in December,therefore not much danger of the candy melting. So - what went wrong? - why wasn't I happy with my purchase considering that the chocolate was not melted and I love Lindt?  I've had these chocolate truffles before and they have always had a creamy center.  So the raspberry chocolates were supposed to have a creamy raspberry center - all liquid, gooey and delicious.  The ones I recieved do not have a creamy center!!  I have no idea why this is.  Maybe these chocolates are defective?  I don't know.  But there is NO raspberry in these chocolates.  They sort of smell of raspberries.  But when you eat them they are just chocolate - which is not what I thought I was ordering.  The chocolate is a little old with some white spots on it, but that doesn't bother me that much. They still taste like high quality chocolate.  I'm thinking about melting them into a fondue.  I'm just dissapointed because I wanted raspberry filling :(  At the same time I also ordered the mint truffles as well.  I have not recieved them yet.  I'm hoping that they will have the mint filling.  I hope it works out.  I might order Lindt chocolates again from Amazon, but probably not the truffles.  I'll see if I can get the truffles from somewhere else.  If you are really into high quality - mass produced chocolate I recommend buying from Russel Stover.  Last summer I bought 2 boxes of Mint Dreams, a box with milk chocolate and a box of dark chocolate.  I had to pay more for shipping during the summer because they packed the shipping box FULL of ice packs.  Nothing was melted and the Mint Dreams were AMAZING.  And Mint Dreams are almost impossible to find in my area - So I was extremely happy with Russel Stover.  They cost a bit more but they were worth it."

However, the description of ""Pack of six 40-count boxes"" was less descriptive than was useful. Upon opening one of the six boxes the internal foil packet had 4 tea bags in each and each tea bag was smaller than a ""normal"" tea bag. I had to use two to get the same strength as I usually do. The ""savings"" were not worth the hassle of dealing with open packets that needed to be stored, and doubling up on tea bags. I was disappointed because I love Bigelow teas. I will continue to buy Bigelow, but not in bulk."

Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese-monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo-kittie...he begs for bread and crackers.<br /><br />Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here's their review: Eh, I'm bored.<br /><br />When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean-up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.<br /><br />The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn't too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.<br /><br />All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart-Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours."

Yes, the first ingredient in (all) Larabars is dates, and here it's very evident. Certainly a nutritious enough snack, but the cherries and almonds are pretty subtle and the flavor isn't top-notch.<br />Apple Pie is tasty and available on clearance from Target quite often.<br />Chococonut Chew tastes like chocolatey dates, as evidenced by the coconut as the final ingredient and dates as the first. Almonds overpower your mouth and the taste.<br />Cashew Cookie tastes just like a solidified version of my homemade cashew butter; would not invest in such a thing. Overly salty and bland, and a pretty hideous thing, too.<br />Pecan Pie is alright but certainly not a buy-twice.<br />Same w/ PB Cookie, which tasted more of peanuts than anything resembling a PB cookie.<br />PB & J<br />Coconut Cream Pie is atrocious, tasting like coconut oil and absolutely no cream component."
373432,B001BM62T4,A3MFORLOKIOEQY,J. S. Green,0,0,4,1244678400,"Interesting Taste, Needs to be Prepared Right","I'm not quite sure what I expected from this product, and after sampling it I'm not quite sure what it is.<br /><br />This is actually not a ""tea"" at all, but rather Roobios (Aspalathus Linearis), ground up into what the manufacturer calls ""Espresso ground"". In actuality, the ground is a bit more course than espresso.<br /><br />First of all, I must describe my espresso setup. I am using a Briel Lido espresso machine, which is a manual machine that makes coffee at about 180 degrees and has a 15 milibar pump.<br /><br />The instructions say to use 4 rounded teaspoons for a shot of espresso. I found that to be about two standard scoops. However, when I tried that, my machine had problems - unlike coffee, the ""tea"" doesn't provide a seal, and the first time I tried it, I had to hold the handle to keep the ""tea"" from going all over the place and ejecting the stuff all over. I discovered that using ONE scoop would work OK, although on some cups I still had to hold the handle closed.<br /><br />As to the flavor, well, it has it's own distinctive flavor, that is different from any ""natural"" tea. I did find out that you need to have boiling water for this tea to extract correctly. My machine allows me to heat the water either to about 180 degrees, or to make it steaming hot (to be diverted to the froth mechanism, but it will go out through the coffee filter is you turn on the pump). When one uses boiling water, the tea tastes good. However, if your coffee maker does not allow you to divert the boiling water to your coffee, this tea will not taste right. Actually, although I abhor them, this tea would make well with a steam powered espresso maker (which boils the water to force water through the coffee). It might also do very well with the traditional stove top Italian espresso maker, where the water is forced up from the bottom, or even an old fashioned perculator. I don't think it would taste good in a standard coffee maker, because in my opinion the water needs to be forced through the ""tea"".<br /><br />I can't really describe the flavor. It is not very bitter (I drink it straight), and is is somewhat ""earthy"". OK, some people might say it tastes like what one would think tree bark might taste like, but then it is a natural ""Tea""; it isn't going to taste like any normal tea or coffee drink. When prepared with boiling water, I actually liked the flavor - but it isn't my favorite hot drink.<br /><br />The packaging suggests making cappucino and latte, but there is no way that this was strong enough (in my opinion) to be able to make those two drinks. I didn't try it iced.<br /><br />Recommended? Well, I don't know. I gave it four stars for it's unique flavor, the very cool red color, and it's supposed health benefits. I'm not a natural foods person, so I don't know if any product health claims are correct. If you are into these kinds of natural ""teas"", then this one is worth a shot (pardon the pun)."

The Strawberry is horrible, icy with a very strong whey protein taste. Being on a reduce calorie diet and getting ice cream that is also high in protein and fiber is a BIG winner for me."

Instead it's a flavored liquid in a bottle with a roller ball something like a deodorant applicator.<br /><br />We have a beagle who loves treats and loves to chew.  I thought he would like this treat simply because I was giving it to him.  He did understand that he had to lick the ball to get the flavor, but he wasn't impressed.  Two sniffs, three licks and he was done.<br /><br />I don't think this treat is safe for dogs unless you stand there and hold it for them.  Any chewing on their part will either separate the roller ball from the end and choke them, or their teeth will puncture the container and the liquid will go everywhere.  It's certainly not a treat you can give them and turn your back.<br /><br />I much prefer treats that they can totally eat, and I can't see this ""rollerball"" treat being very popular with pet owners."

The taste is very bland (unlike other brown rice pasta that I've had) and the noodles are so small that they seem to divide and conquer the plate and completely take over. These are thinner than regular vermicelli and probably should just be labeled as an Asian brown rice noodle instead of trying to be an Italian vermicelli noodle. If you're seeking a brown rice noodle that tastes good and has substance to it, this isn't it. Try Tinkyada instead."

Unfortunately, our luck ran out with the Chicken and Broccoli dinner kit.  First, as many others have pointed out.  The broccoli is a freeze dried, powdery substance (but of course it would have to be, in order to keep in a box) and has the look of parsley flakes.  There was no discernable broccoli taste in the finished product. I'm not particulary fond of orzo pasta, but in this case I don't think another type of pasta would have changed anything with the taste, but perhaps the texture would have been a little better.  I used just a bit under 1 pound of chicken, and I don't think the seasoning packet contained enough, because the dish was quite bland.  However, there was plenty of the Velveeta cheese sauce, but, as much as my kids and husband love it, it was not enough to save this meal.  Also, the look of the meal was very bland and had no visual appeal. As I stated with my reviews of the other Velveeta Skillets, one box is not enough for the four members of my family who don't eat baby food.  With the other meals I prepared two boxes of the meal, but with this one I only prepared one, and used it more as a ""side"" dish to a large salad and breadsticks.

That was many months ago, now I get two cases of this stuff delivered a month!  I've tried about five of Nero's flavors of drinks and Sonic is easily my favorite, it's got a tangy citrus taste (kinda grapefruit like) that is not only delicious but also quite healthy as it's packed with a lot of great vitamins and minerals that give you a healthy boost of energy, not a buzz.  I wouldn't go as far to say it really helps to stimulate the brain as it advertises, but it definitely does a better job at boosting energy and making you fell good than energy drinks and soda does.  I've also found myself losing a little weight, as I'd rather drink one of these than a soda and I seem to not be as hungry if I sip on this throughout the day, and at only 35 calories with minimal sugar it's the perfect drink alternative.  Now everyone complains about the price, but for me you can't really put a price on health.  Nero Sonic gives me the energy I need throughout the day, it's healthy, it's helped ween me off drinking a lot of soda, and in my opinon it tastes great.  Now I understand taste is subjective but if you can stomach the taste of energy drinks this is sweet nectar compared to most of those.  Sure you could just drink water and that might be even better for you, but water is boring and in my stressful daily life I need something with a little kick that I look forward to everyday, thankfully it's healthier than most sugary alternatives, and when I add up want I spent on sodas or energy drinks it's really not anymore costly."

I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.

It was my favorite above any other brands I tried.  This is not the same tuna it was before.<br /><br />I noticed a decline in quality for some time.  The tuna had a stronger smell.  There was often nuclear-orange glowing color on top of the tuna.  The size of the cans got smaller.  One can used to yield a few sandwiches.  Now you have to open at least two cans for two people.  When you drain the liquid out, the lid goes so far down because there isn't as much tuna as there used to be.  But that isn't the worst part.<br /><br />I noticed this year that every can I've opened has had some sort of sludgy gel-like goo surrounding the tuna.  I touched it to see what it was like and it feels like grimy slime.  I wondered if this was a bad batch (we usually buy lots of cans at a time) or some sort of new way they are packing it.  I looked it up and saw others were finding the same thing in their tuna.  I tried eating some of it after getting most of the goo off.  But it did not taste very good.  I now regret eating it at all after reading the following.<br /><br />Apparently the company was once owned by Del Monte, but was sold to a South Korean tuna company that was hoping to get into the American market.  For what reason?  To poison us?  Seriously, I can't imagine what they put in these cans.  I also read that they refused to provide records to the FDA when asked.  That can't be good.  Why is this stuff still on our store shelves?  Why are American companies selling out to foreign ones all the time?  Americans are finding it harder and harder to afford groceries.  We don't want to spend our money on trash products.  I will never buy Starkist again unless it one day makes its way back to American hands.  There is obviously something wrong with it.  Just look at it and smell it next time you open a can.  It's no longer the tasty tuna of yesteryear.  It is now tuna bits in slimy, tuna-flavored sludge water."

The shape, size and markings on the bar strongly suggest that Komforte is made and/or owned by the same outfit that makes Seattle Chocolates.<br /><br />The quality of the chocolate itself is pretty good. It's good enough that it could stand on its own without playing up the quirk factor (Komforte's other offbeat chocolate bar flavors include French Toast and Tortilla Lime + Salt), but then they probably wouldn't be able to command premium prices for these chocolate bars. I'll probably try the others just to see what they're like, but I suspect the novelty factor wears off pretty quickly -- and then all you have left to market is an overpriced chocolate bar.<br /><br />(This review was originally published in slightly modified form at the author's blog, Confessions of a Laundry Faerie.)"

I already have a bad enough memory, which has gotten worse (and I'm only 36!!) so I obviously got spooked. Then I read that Stevis is the best 'natural' no calorie sweetner out there (I wonder how long it will take for some article to come out and tell you how bad it is for you?) Anyhow, I bought PureVia, and it had an awful after taste, it was truly as if this was some chemicaly fabricated substitute rather than 'natural' I though: "" OK, maybe is the brand.""<br /> Then I bought, Truvia, same thing, that after taste again. Finally I bought Sun Cryslals -- which is not quite sugar free, each packet has 2g of sugar-- I figure, ""they know how bad this thing tastes that is why they are mixing it with actual sugar."" It's just as bad.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say, but I rather have the Splenda and Equal anyday rather than this product.

124363,B005ZBZM52,A19NMTN66EKHM1,J. Gross,1,1,5,1343606400,Best and Cheapest K-Cup Option I've Found,"These k-cups are cheap because they don't have the plastic cup base. That means that they don't keep as long, but frankly I haven't had an issue with that. They are delivered in 12-pack bags with most of the air pushed out of a valve. I immediately put them in the freezer except for the current 12 I'm using. I drink about 3 cups a day, and keep the open k-cups in a sealed plastic bag on a shelf. Quality has not degraded to a point where I've even noticed.<br /><br />A few notes:<br />- This is apparently the same bean mix they use in Fog Chaser, but it clearly is a lighter roast. I find it suits my taste preferences better than Fog Chaser, and my understanding is that a lighter roast means more caffeine.<br />- A normal k-cup has a plastic base, the filter basket with the grounds, a plastic ring to hold the basket in place, and a metal foil seal. These are significantly cheaper in part because they don't have that cup. This leads to my storing the 12-packs in the freezer until I need them. I would suggest trying the ones with the full cup first to figure out if this (or Fog Chaser) can be your regular coffee, and if so, definitely get these.<br />- One issue that I don't care about, but others do, is that the cup isn't there to catch the really fine grounds. You will end up with some grounds at the bottom of your cup. If that bugs you, don't get these. The grounds are very fine and don't affect the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />Oh, the taste: it's a medium roast perhaps on the lighter side of the spectrum. If you like a darker roast (e.g., that popular coffee chain that burns their beans to ashes, IMHO),  then you'll like Fog Chaser more probably. The acidity and bitterness are well-balanced. I drink my coffee straight black, which is how I like it; if I kept the same taste but switched to cream and/or sugar, I would go with Fog Chaser. The thing I like about this blend/roast is that it has excellent flavor with a hint of nuttiness. It doesn't have a ton of body, IMHO, but that's just what I've found to be the case with the Keurig. I'm thinking about the K2, but I'll wait for more pod choices.<br /><br />Finally, I'll be honest, I don't buy these for eco reasons; I'm too picky about my coffee. However, there is less waste and, if I was the sort of person to compost, it would be very easy to separate the basket from the ring and compost the grounds."

Yes, everything below was true but it was no fault of the product. The KEY to kettle style popcorn machines is proper temperature. The process to get big kernels is simple and is as follows:<br /><br />- Let the kettle heat empty for 5 minutes.<br />- Put popping oil in kettle and let it heat for another 5 minutes.<br />- Put in popcorn and salt and wait for the magic to happen.<br /><br />All of the problems I was experiencing below went away when I followed the procedure above. Popcorn pops real big and fluffy. I'm all out of corn right now and will be giving the Chiefs Choice brand a try to compare the two.<br /><br />--------------------OLD INACCURATE REVIEW BELOW -----------------<br />I had read a few other reviews here on Amazon that said this popcorn wasn't very good (Coconut oil flavor) and I have to agree. I thought I could suck it up and eat all of it but there is no way I will be able to do it. It's just nasty plain and simple. I'm using a Paramount popper and it works very well.<br /><br />My findings:<br /><br />- Kernels pop real small and are very chewy. Not big light and fluffy.<br />- Overall taste of the popcorn is not very good. Popcorn has a nasty coconut oil flavor to it. I thought maybe reducing the premeasured oil to half would help but it still has a coconut oil flavor to it.<br /><br />Overall, it's pretty bad and maybe I just ended up with an old batch or something because when you taste the popcorn you could swear that it's old. I'm hearing there is a brand called Chief's Choice and I will order some of that today and give it a try."

They add a nice flavoring to the soup and even a overall salty taste, leaving you to add less salt to your soup.<br /><br />Also, I made some sushi using there. They were a bit hard to wrap because of their texture. They do come with perforated lines to show you were to make your cuts for sushi, but it didn't help. Unless you have a super sharp, samurai type knife (pun intended), then these sheets will be hard to cut through. That may well be the case with any seaweed sheet, but I would not know because this was the first time I made sushi.<br /><br />One other thing I could mention is these sheets are pretty big if you are making sushi wraps, especially if you place to roll the seaweed with the rice on the OUTSIDE of the roll. You could definitely get away with using a half a sheet. If you are rolling the rice on the INSIDE like I did, then you might have to use the whole sheet, but they will still be too big and you will waste a bit unless you cut it off and use the extra in a soup later.<br /><br />Even still, the sushi turned out amazing (even though I wasted quite a bit because of the cutting issue).<br /><br />I still recommend these sheets and will be buying more."

Inferior brands tend to smell like overstewed salsa or Rotel gone rancid when you open them up, so you'd know right away it's not good. I find those ones to be worthless - the peppers lack that tasty smokey hotness and the adobo sauce tastes as bad as it smells. But not this brand. These smell and taste smokey and slighly vinegary like chipotles in adobo are supposed to.<br /><br />Empacadora San Marcos thankfully doesn't disguise any of their ingredients under the vague label ""spices"" (like other brands) so you know exactly what you're eating, and they don't use nasty soybean oil (which seems to do something strange and unpleasant to the peppers). I've also found that they are usually the lesser expensive brand on the shelf. It's even cheaper in bulk. So heck of a deal.<br /><br />The local grocery store that carried this brand here went under, and I haven't found it elsewhere so far. So I'm greatly thankful I can buy these here at Amazon. I'll gladly order these online then settle for something inferior (and any good chipotle-phile will understand that without reservation)."

Apparently dogs find working for their dinner to be entertaining. It actually is really great. I just unscrew the bottom, pour the kibble in, and then my dog spends the next 20-30 minutes getting it out. And he does seem entertained - I think eating his food slower makes him feel fuller too. I mix this up with a couple of other kibble dispensers so he doesn't get too used to just one way - then it would be boring again. One warning - the med/large is really good. My friend has a small and a full cup of kibble fits easily into it. Unless you are feeding your dog a lot, you probably don't need the big one."

I was a little hesitant to try it because I had been happy with the cleanliness of the Roland quinoa and I wasn't sure what pearl quinoa was. Upon receiving it, I was very pleasantly surprised. First of all, pearl quinoa is actually white quinoa. It is very clean so I don't really have to rinse it, and the individual grains are much larger than the Roland quinoa. Best of all, it isn't full of static electricity. We store our grains in 5 gallon plastic containers, and when we poured the bag of Roland quinoa into the bucket, it literally jumped out, stuck to the bag, and some flew out onto the floor. Once in the bucket, the grain that didn't jump out stuck to the sides of the bucket. It was truly a challenge to get it into the bucket without making a big mess. It was so nice when this quinoa just poured into the bucket like any other grain - no muss, no fuss. Hopefully, the price of this one doesn't start to skyrocket. I love this quinoa!!<br /><br />Update!! 6/16/2012<br />Well, the price of this quinoa went from a subscription price of a bit over $68 to $118. So I am off to find another source.

I saw the commercial for this product on tv and decided to try it out. The berry flavor's not too bad-it tastes like liquified smarties. I also liked the fact that it promises that you won't crash (I had several classes and work the following day) and that it's only 4 calories. The no-refrigeration is also handy when you only want to drink half of the bottle.<br /><br />I drank a whole bottle after deciding that half wouldn't give me enough juice to stay up. I did start feeling it after a couple of minutes and I actually lasted for about 8 more hours before I started feeling drowsy. There was no crash and I didn't feel any bad effects. I definitely recommend this to anyone and plan on using it again.

If you are health conscious and want to drink something like a soda w/o actually drinking a soda, this would probably be right down your alley.<br /><br />However, I found the taste to be somewhat... odd.  I could definitely taste the tangerine in it mixed with the orange, but the combination of the two or the bottling or something gives this Switch a taste akin to eating an orange that is ALMOST too ripe.

Not exactly something that I'd look forward to drinking.<br /><br />So for me, although this was somewhat good, its not exactly something I would get again.

I wanted even better--so we ordered these Bob's Red Mill Pizza Crust bags. I have made this 2x now. The first time I followed directions to the T and it turned out rubbery and gooey. The 2nd time I read EVERY review and followed the extra instructions. My Husband and I are sitting here with full bellies from this pizza--because we ate the yummy TOPPINGS, only. On an EFFORT note: It doesn't take that long--cause you let the dough rise -while you are making the chicken and onions and garlic & peppers, etc for the pizza. I even pre-seasoned the dough & forked it & oiled it and cooked it and made sure it was VERY flat. After 15 mins, I grabbed a bite of the crispy dough-before I added the toppings and it tasted like...DOG FOOD biscuits!

277764,B002OMV09W,A3TA05EXOE2ZYY,chilipro,5,5,5,1323043200,"Ghost chili in a can, great item","Please do not listen to the writers who had bad experiences. These seeds in cans are a good product, but additional information will help you to be successful. I have purchased a dozen of these cans and I have gotten plants from every can. You must be patient and keep the cans in a warm area of your house. I keep the can under a grow light and near a heat vent to keep it warm. The seeds do not need light to sprout but warmth helps a lot. Experts say ideal is for the dirt to be 80-90 degrees F. Germination can take 1-6 weeks so do not throw your cans away. Be patient! I have gotten 3-6 seedlings from every can. Water the seeds, then re-water when the top of the planting material is dry. The last can I bought I successfully got 4 plants started, and my current can just sprouted a plant after a week because I concentrated on keeping it warm.<br /><br />After the seedlings sprout let them grow for a time in the can. Water when the material they are growing in is dry on the surface. They hate too much water and will die quickly if over-watered. Wait until the seedlings have 4 leaves before transplanting. Dig deep when getting the seedling out of the can to transplant because the roots go straight down. Scoop down twice as deep as the plant is above the ground. They need to grow inside for 8-10 weeks before planting outside, and they take 160-180 days from planting to harvest. So calculating the time needed for germination and inside growth you need to start 12-16 weeks before you plan spring planting, then an additional 5-6 months for harvest. Total time can be 9-10 months start to finish. So if you plan to plant March 15th you need to start now. These chili peppers take a long time but are definitely worth it if you like hot chili peppers. Good luck, have fun."

A beautiful salt that was a pink/beige color, a great texture and size, and lovely taste that enhanced all food.  It came in a baggie...sigh.  I've been looking to replace it ever since so I thought I'd try this salt.  My honest reaction about this salt - I don't get it.  I like the course texture of the salt.  It's a bit more chunky then we like though you do feel it when you eat.  The taste?  Here it is, I don't get it.  There is a critical mass point putting this salt on your food - and what we feel is that it's nothing or simply too much.  I know, I'm giving a lot of words here.  It's just that there are all these great reviews of how amazing it is.  The salt is kind of tasteless on the finger.  On food it seems to need a lot and then ICK!!!!  So my recommendation is a 3 because maybe we simply haven't found the exact amount to use to create the taste everyone is raving about.  I keep trying and it's either no taste at all or so over powering the food is awful.  For the price I'm tossing it in the garbage because it's too much a pain at meal time when I'm trying to figure it out.  I can't say it's awful because maybe it's us.  We are salt lovers and we buy and understand salt.  This salt?  I don't get it.  And that is actually saying something.  So I guess I'll take a stand and say - we don't like it.  I've tried it on simple and complex food and recipes.  Too risky when time is so busy these days to have to find a balance of the amount you use.

The flavor profile is very, very herbal and grassy - quite strongly so. The mate itself actually looks and smells somewhat like cut grass. Once steeped (generally slightly below boiling for about 5 minutes), the result is a slightly greenish tea that tastes very earthy. I am of mixed feelings about it. I like earthy flavors and after two or so days, I got used to it and almost liked it. On the other hand, if I am comparing it to roasted mate (which is darker and has a sort of nutty flavor), there is no contest; the latter is better. (Davidson's also sells another <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SARK1Y"">Davidson's Tea Bulk, Mezclado De M&aacute;te, 16-Ounce Bag</a> that allegedly is spiced with cinnamon and I bet that is pretty decent). If you like earthy teas, you might give this one a try and would probably come a similar conclusion: 3 stars. If you dislike earthy flavors dominating your tea, you might avoid this mate.<br /><br />FYI: this tea is often drunk for its high level of caffeine without the jittery effect of coffee. While it is true that mate has as much caffeine as coffee, the caffeine metabolizes slowly (because it bonds with the tea's tannins). Therefore, the caffeine absorbs in the bloodstream fairly slowly, giving the drinker a more pleasant 'steady flow' of energy."

For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these ""natural"" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.

They are not available in stores where I live.  Ordering them online via Amazon is great.  These cherries are the beginnings of the perfect pie.  Creativity is your only limitation.<br /><br />It's easy to make a delicious pie from scratch.  First, make enough pie crust dough for a two-crust pie.  (Never buy a pie crust when you can make a better tasting one at home).<br /><br />Place the bottom crust into a deep pie pan and crimp the edges.  Next open a can of Oregon Fruit Pitted Red Tart Cherries in water and drain the water.  Put contents into a large mixing bowl.  Now let your imagination run wild!  Add a can of Oregon Raspberries, and perhaps a half a can of Oregon Blueberries, both drained, as I did yesterday, or almost any variety of Oregon berries that you can get your hands on.<br /><br />Add about 1/2 cup of sugar & 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to the berry mixture and stir it all up.  Place into the pie pan and cover with the top pie crust.  Make steam slits into the top crust, and dab with milk or butter, and then sprinkle sugar atop.  Bake at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes to an hour.  That's it!<br /><br />The end result is a delicious pie that tastes better than anything you can buy in a store or bakery, and has much less sugar.  You can, of course, add more sugar to the berry mixture if you like, but I like the cherries to taste tart.<br /><br />So go ahead and make a pie!"

Many quick, powdered drinks are one-note, but this one isn't. It manages to be both sweet and tart like real apple cider, and has just a hint of cinnamon and mulled spice in the background. During long, cold winters, it's so nice to have a fast treat like this cider to help warm you up inside.<br /><br />Because these have a good amount of Vitamin C, they are also excellent for the inevitable winter colds. On those horrible days when even opening and heating a can of chicken soup seems too hard, all you have to do is switch your electric kettle to on, dump the packet into a cup and you're good to go. Maybe a cup of apple cider a day can even keep the doctor away, who knows?<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the Alpine Spiced Cider Drink Mixes as a quick and easy way to enjoy a hot beverage. It won't be as authentic as homemade cider, but it won't be a hassle to prepare either.<br /><br />Note: You can also find these at national chain warehouse stores for a reasonable price, but because they're considered a seasonal item, be aware that you will have the best luck (and best deals) during fall and winter."

Unfortunately that is not the case.<br /><br />I followed the directions on the container to soften the product so that I could mix the oil back into the coconut. I ended up using an immersion blender to thoroughly mix it which worked very well.<br /><br />I find it almost inedible. The texture is gritty and very thick. It sticks to the inside of my mouth and leaves an unpleasant dry sensation. It doesn't ""melt"" in my mouth as described on the container. I don't enjoy the taste either. The pure taste of coconut oil is there, but with another taste mixed in that ruins it and leaves an aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed. I'm planning on trying another brand of coconut butter and see if it's a problem with the Nutiva brand or just my own taste/texture preferences. It's not anywhere near the expiration date, it doesn't taste rancid and the container was properly sealed, so I assume that the product is fresh.<br /><br />Update: 2-13-2012 - I purchased some Artisana organic raw coconut butter and compared the two. I have to say that I like the Artisana brand better. It's smoother and the color is lighter. It's also packaged in a glass jar which I prefer. The taste is also somewhat better. I now know that I don't really like coconut butter, it's just not for me. I would recommend that if you buy coconut butter buy the Artisana brand."

At room temperature, it is solid....and if I have one tiny complaint, it can be a little difficult to spoon out of the jar. I don't want to soften/melt it each time I need a teaspoonful, so I struggle a bit and scoop it out.<br /><br />  On toast or English muffins, you can use it just like butter, but it seems to have a much more pleasant taste, and leaves the bread more crispy, {never soggy like butter can sometimes pool on toast in little patches.} To use making scrambled eggs or an omelet, it's easy to use, just like any oil, and adds no real discernible taste to me. It's great to just take some and rub on your skin, you then smell wonderful, and it soaks right in....leaving your skin smooth and silky. I have dry skin, and using this coconut oil or almond oil is something that has changed my life....tossing out all the ""off the shelf"" lotions that never really helped.<br /><br />  Only time will tell if all the health benefits pan out for me. But I enjoy using this instead of butter, and plan to continue to do so. The price is great here on Amazon, especially on Subscribe and Save. It was delivered quickly, although it was just tossed into a large box, and allowed to roll around in transit, which I thought was strange packaging. But it was undamaged, and still solid, no evidence of leakage in the box.<br /><br />  I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to try healthier oils, and anyone with dry skin. I read online that this can be mixed with garlic oil and Vit. E liquid to make a healing ointment. There is a lot of info online regarding the positives of coconut oil, and Dr. Oz recommends it, for what that is worth to you."

I can fix taste and I eat diet food even if the taste is compromised, like fat free cheese.  The texture of these noodles weren't the worst part. Yes, they are slimy (almost like noodles that have been sitting in water way to long) because they come preserved in a fluid. So they are rubbery and slimy. Not the worst part though. The worst part is when you open the bag, it smells horribly of FISH- GROSS! I almost gagged. I rinsed them and cooked them in a pan with a little olive oil, cracked black pepper, fresh garlic to try and mask the smell, some parmesan cheese & tomatoes. From the first bite I expected it to taste like fish, but it wasn't a fishy taste. It tastes like you are eating noodles covered in soap. I know that sounds odd. It was NOT my dish, I have tried these a few times (fettuccine, spaghetti and other ones) and each and every time, strong fish smell, slimy noodles and soapy taste.<br /><br />NOT WORTH SAVING SOME CALORIES AND CARBS if you have to gag the food down.

I don't know if it's the pasteurization process or what, but this brand of carrot juice does *not* taste like carrot juice. I would hate for people to buy it and think they don't like carrot juice due to how this tastes. I don't know what their process is, but the end result is very icky.

We followed the directions exactly and made half (24) as mini-cupcakes and half (12) as regular cupcakes. The batter was evenly divided and all the cups were filled the same. Yet, the batter expanded and spilled out when it was cooking, then while they cooled they flattened out with a concave dip in the center. The next morning I tried to frost them, but they were so sticky that dark, cupcake sludge stuck to the frosting. We're not talking heavy frosting either, a light whip cream frosting. When they were served, no one ate more than a single bite and put them down. Usually the kids (4-8 years old) will eat anything sweet, but they all spit it out on their plates. The adults were polite enough to swallow. The final texture was a slippery sweet sludge on top, firm and springy on the bottom, and a grittiness that may be typical of rice flour, (I had noticed the same grittiness in the otherwise delicious bread mix from another company)."

Making a different dish (has to have different protein source and flavoring) every other night is the only way I can keep weight on this once food-frenzied chow hound. Being older, he requires multiple medications multiple times a day.  He refuses to eat peanut butter (which I used in the past to give him his medications) due to the undesirable texture that makes it difficult for him to handle and swallow.  The soft, moist texture of the pill pockets allows me to smash it into the ball of medications so that Dakota is not able to separate the unwanted medications from the tasty pill pockets and spit out the meds -- like he has done with other similar items.  The large size allows me to administer multiple medications per pill pocket.  Being a picky eater, Dakota will occasionally refuse the med-filled pill pocket, but that's usually when he's not feeling well and won't eat anything anyway.  I assume he likes the taste since he'll more often than not voluntarily eat the pill pocket; however, he doesn't seem to voraciously eat the pill-filled pockets like he does with other treats that he really likes."

Kim ""siva""",2,4,5,1322524800,Ramen connoiseur's review & tips on the Shin Ramen,"Review:<br />I've eaten ramen for a long time (30+ years) and have eaten numerous varieties and the Shin ramen is probably my #1 tasting. The reasons are as follows:<br />* Best flavor broth - it's spicy (but adjustable), leaves a good aftertaste (yes, even when you burp), tint of mushroom flavor coupled with a good balance of red pepper, onions and spices.<br />* Noodles have good texture - depending how you cook them of course but with bad ones, no matter how you cook them they come out soggy/soft. These come out chewy if you want or softer if you overcook them.<br />* It's not oily - I've noticed with some noodles, you can see a ring of oil around the pot after you cook the noodles. So with these I sometimes had to boil an extra pot of water and then transfer the cooked noodles to the fresh pot of water to get rid of the oil. Not with Shin Ramen.<br />* Economical - for less than a dollar a pack, they beat any dollar menu item<br />* Great for any weather - particularly winter to keep you warm. In the summer, they help to break out a sweat and opens your pores<br />* Can be a hearty meal - you can add all types of things to this ramen as others have posted. An egg is recommended but so are vegetables and meat.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />Amount of water - add about 2 mug size cup fulls of water. If not sure, add a little less. You can always add more after it's fully cooked. Adding cold water at the end cools down the boiling hot soup so it's easier to eat.<br /><br />How to cook - wait til the water boils. As soon as it does, drop in everything: the soup base, noodles, dried vegie packet. If you want to add vegies, let it cook for about a minute before adding e.g. mushrooms, bean sprouts, tomatoes, green onions. Don't put more than a quarter couple of any vegies or meat cuz you'll kill the flavor. For eggs, if you like them well cooked, add them at the beginning. You can add at the end of cooking too but this is a bit too raw for my taste<br /><br />Cooking time - boil the noodles 2 - 4 minutes. This depends on how hard or soft you like your noodles. Just pull a strand out and taste it every 30 seconds after the first minute. There's no right or wrong here.<br /><br />Soup base - add all of it. Don't worry about it being too spicy. Per above you can always water it down later. The soup will be plenty hot. Remember it just finished boiling and it's difficult to put something in your mouth when it was just boiling.<br /><br />How to serve - there are 3 ways I'd recommend<br />1) The traditional Korean way - folks like to eat straight from the pot. There's actually an 'art' to this. After removing it from the stove, place the pot on something that wont burn. Grab the lid of the pot, a spoon (yes a spoon) and chop sticks (fork if you can't wield them).<br /><br />2) In a bowl. Don't use a plastic one unless it can stand the heat. I don't like to use plastic period for health reasons but up to you. Remove some of the excess soup from the pot first and then pour everything directly into the bowl. Grab a spoon and chopsticks/fork and place the bowl down and go to work.<br /><br />3) combination of 1 and 2 above. Place the pot of ramen and get a bowl along with a spoon and chopsticks/fork.<br /><br />How to eat:<br />First, forget what your parents have told you on slurping. To eat ramen, you must slurp. Why? Because 1) if you don't you'll burn your lips because no slurping means the noodles must pass through your lips slower and enclosed more around the noodles. 2) because your lips are more enclosed, most of the soup around the noodles are sucked away from noodles, leaving you with less flavorful noodles. So forget the decorum. Eat it asian style and slurp away.<br /><br />2nd, I'd recommend the Korean way (#1 above). You grab the pot lid then take about 2 mouthful amounts of noodle and dump it into the lid. You should be holding the lid with your left hand (switch if you're right handed) and quickly grab a large spoon and add several spoonfuls of soup broth into the lid. You're doing 3 things here 1) you're saturating the noodles with the flavorful broth. 2) by adding the noodles to the lid, you're cooling it down for consumption while keeping the rest of the noodles hot. 3) When you eat straight from the lid, you first eat the noodles and immediately follow up with a slurp from the lid itself to drink the soup base. To do this, you put the lid close to your mouth and then push the noodles in with your utensil, drink the soup right after or together as you push the noodles in. I know this sounds crude but the flavor is maximized this way. You can add any vegetables or meat to eat bite this way too.<br /><br />If you want to eat using method #2, well, it needs no explanation, just make sure you slurp and drink the broth as you eat the noodles.<br /><br />For method #3, you're basically substituting the bowl for the lid. Works as well but assuming your lid is metal, it keeps the noodles hotter. Also, people tend to put more noodles into a bowl then a lid and this ends up cooling the noodle down too much. It's also slower cuz you dont hold the bowl in your hand where as with the lid, since you're holding it, you grab noodles, place them briefly on the lid then straight to your mouth. It's cooler too ;>)<br /><br />Third, some people like to make this a heartier meal by adding rice. I usually don't add the rice to the pot until I'm half-way through because it's too hot and because the meal loses its flavor and it's too heavy. However, by adding rice directly to the pot full of ramen, you have more of a hearty meal.<br /><br />Now, enjoy!"

It does get closer to Starbucks than any of the other decaf k-cups I have tried. But in a way it goes too far and results in a somewhat strange and overpowering taste.<br /><br />I had tried Timothy's decaf and Newman's Own decaf, with the latter vastly superior to the former. I would say Tully's beats Timothy's (which is just brown water), but probably not Newman's. I also tried Donut Shop decaf simultaneously with Tully's (I had Donut Shop at work and Tully's at home). For the first few days, I thought Donut Shop was a little weak and I liked Tully's better for its bolder flavor. But after a couple of weeks I grew tired and a little sick of Tully's strong taste - it's not just strong like a normal cup of Starbucks, it's strong almost like they added some kind of artificial chemical to it to make it taste darker or more burned than it really is. After one month I was long done with the Donut Shop and was just slowly getting through the Tully's (diluted with lots of milk).<br /><br />When I reordered, I only considered Newman's or Donut Shop. I couldn't bring myself to drink another cup of Tully's. It's a shame because they definitely took a step in the right direction with their stronger flavor, but it was a misstep that makes the coffee a poor choice for long-term consumption.<br /><br />Perhaps a good strategy for a newcomer would be to order Tully's AND another brand or two like Newman's and Donut Shop, and trade off which one they drink. That might make Tully's flavor less grating over time"

For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it."

It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes and muffins.  We even found a diabetic powder that you can mix with ice, fresh strawberries, some of this flavoring, and skim milk and then blend into a dietetic strawberry shake.  If you freeze your strawberries and add in a little Splenda® then the taste is really good.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found.  They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!"

Beautiful Product, Delivered Fast.","I ordered this rose/asiatic lily bouquet early on a Tues morning, and it arrived at her doorstep by 3PM the next day!  I had no hard-and-fast date that they had to arrive, so I chose the cheapest shipping ($12.99, and no free option, but hey, they're flowers--you want it done right).  It was well worth the shipping cost.  MUCH faster than the estimated delivery date w/o having to pay to expedite.  Falcon Farms apparently used FedEx standard next-day.  Thanks!  The tracking feature was also very accurate with FedEx.  I knew exactly where it was at every key point, which enabled me to alert her to its early arrival to within about an 2-hour window.<br /><br />The flowers delivered exactly as they were pictured and described (actually with more roses & lilies than promised and a classy tissue and bow selection to tie-up the bouquet).  Roses were healthy, deep red, and full; delicate lilies arrived as buds, as they said they would.  Even the eucalyptus and ""bear grass"" (What do I know about botany? I'm just a regular guy.) turned out to be great accents.  My personalized message was also there, just as I wrote it during the order process.<br /><br />I wanted a bouquet to send (just because) to the woman I just started seeing recently--something really nice, but in a slightly understated way that wasn't too fussy or frilly or with a million things going on.  I also wanted something that could be seen as romantic, but not clich&eacute; or over-the-top. ...Tough to strike that balance, and guys know, in a new relationship, you want to modulate these early gestures just right.  This bouquet was perfect (and I scoured many different sites, including FTD and 1-800-Flowers, in addition to Amazon's selection).  Also would be great for a Valentine's Day bouquet.  They are versatile enough to work for a V-Day bouquet for a mother or sister, too.  I buy a lot of other durable goods, but I was initially unsure of how well buying flowers through Amazon would go.  However, this seller is apparently also the grower, and doesn't outsource; I think that makes a huge difference in the consistency of product and process one could expect.  Falcon Farms has found a loyal buyer in me!"

Let's just say that it was disappointing, and that's an understatement. For the next attempt, we tried the time tested method of cooking the chili the day before, letting it cool down, then refrigerating the batch overnight to give all the flavors time to blend. That was a very slight improvement, but not by much. Let's just say that it was reminiscent of some chili that I once had at an obscure New Jersey diner that's no longer in business. There never was a third attempt.<br /><br />Sometimes it's just better to do it yourself. This is the recipe that I use for ""DIY Slow Cooked Chili"" that I learned years ago when living in the South, and the one that I fall back on when in the mood for cooking:<br /><br />* 2 lb. ground beef<br />* 1 1/2 cups chopped onions<br />* 1/2 cup chopped green pepper<br />* 2 garlic cloves, finely cut (not chopped)<br />* 28 oz. can whole tomatoes<br />* 2 (16 oz.) cans kidney beans<br />* 2 tbsp. chili powder<br />* 2 tsp. salt<br />* 2 tsp. cumin<br />* 2 tsp. black pepper<br /><br />Brown the ground beef; add onions, green pepper, garlic, tomatoes, kidney bens, salt, chili powder, pepper and cumin in a slow cooker or crock pot. Cover and simmer on low setting for 6 to 8 hours. Makes 8 to 10 servings. Serve with cornbread and whatever hot sauce you like. Looking forward to trying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008JHROIM"">Tabanero Hot Sauce Picante</a>, as it's been highly recommended.<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />This company also makes <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007680BD0"">Redneck Chill E SPICY</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00767OJDO"">Redneck Habanerah Allives</a> (you'll just have to look at that one), but to date this reviewer has resisted the temptation to try either of these or their other offerings. However, I did receive a box of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7F8G"">Leonard Mountain 3 Amigos Enchilada Stew</a> as a gift from a friend, and this product was easily worth a 5-star recommendation. That was one of the reasons that I tried their chili mix. Go figure.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Cannot say that <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7DTC"">Leonard Mountain Boot Scootin' Green Chile Chili</a> was the worst chili mix that I've ever had, but it's probably borderline close. What one pays for here is cute slogans and clever packaging, and this product is highly overpriced for what you get. Sad to say, even those chili seasoning packets you find in the spice section of your grocery store are better. But the burlap bag packaging was clever, and my son kept the miniature Tabasco green pepper sauce bottle, so I'll give it one star each for the creative packaging and the tiny Tabasco bottle.<br /><br />9/4/2012"

It's a decent mix between the two flavors. It does lean a little more towards the taste of strawberry.<br /><br />While the juice may be decent, the price seems high to me for a can of 8.3 oz juice.

You could not re seal the original bag, and I would not expect to do so, but transfering to zip lock bags or quart jars as I did works well.  I store other mushrooms in  glass quart jars as well and this method keeps them dry on your pantry shelf.

Why? It's convenient, and it's tasty, perhaps slightly better than your typical vending machine/fast food because of the controlled serving portions (each pouch is about one ounce in weight).<br /><br />As of the time of writing, at $10/box, it's not cheap, but if you compare it against retail/school dining choices, it's kind of a bargain, because each pouch comes out to be about 25 cents per pouch. This is one-fourth of the cost of your average vending machine snack. To make it more worthwhile, for college students, Amazon throws in the free shipping with Amazon Prime, which means that it gets delivered straight to your door, which is a HUGE time saver, because you don't need to drive out to the store and buy snacks. Plus, PORTION CONTROL!

They're just really dry and tasteless, almost like a cardboard substance.

The fudge/chocolate melts in your mouth and the cookie is kind of buttery and melts along with the fudge/chocolate. It's really good. My only problem with the cookie is that they market it as a shortbread cookie, which it really isn't ... it's just a fudge cookie. Everyone knows that the Scots/Brits are the best at making shortbread cookie. Nonetheless, digression aside, the fudge cookies are awesome in their own right.<br /><br />Anyways, try one!

A tiny droplet on a chip led to a great smoky initial taste, and a growing burn that topped out at hot, but very manageable.

I love the crunchy crispy texture (not hard like another natural brand I once tried).  There is a grahamy/oaty flavor with a very subtle cinnamon hint afterwards. They are sweet but not too sweet.  Most of the graham crackers on the market contain high fructose corn syrup, so it is nice to have this product as an option that contains only natural sweeteners (Midel is another natural brand but sometimes hard to find).  These crackers are also healthier in that they do not contain partially hydrogenated oils, with safflower oil listed as the oil ingredient (2.5 g fat per 2 full cracker sheet serving).  Decent source of fiber (2 g) and fairly high sugar (7 g) per serving.<br /><br />I have tried making homemade graham crackers but could not get a proper texture, so I am sticking to store-bought for now.  Aside from a delicious snack, I also think this product would make a great graham cracker crust for cheesecake (I will try if I do not eat the whole box first!).  The only negative is that they are slightly expensive and come in a fairly small 10 oz box.<br /><br />I have also tried the Apple Cinnamon variety and I slightly prefer the Apple Cinnamon for snacking since it is more flavorful (4 stars for Golden Honey and 4.5 stars for Apple Cinnamon)."

It really works if you know how to use it.,"Goji juice really does work, but you need to know how to use it. If you are going to try Goji juice, please try this one because it has 6 times the concentrate of pure goji juice than the rest of the type on the market.  It is in a glass bottle with absolutely no added juice, as every type in the white plastic bottle is and cost almost the same or more to by.<br /><br />Goji juice works, but you have to give it time.  You basically needed to make it a daily routine. Drinking about 1-2 ounces on an empty stomach (you can mix with OJ or favorite juice for a better flavor because pure Goji is not really sweet).  Then take about the same amount in the afternoon.  You can take more ounces depending on your health since Goji juice is organic and pure.<br /><br />After about 1 week of taking it regularly you really will start to notice a difference.  I have been taking this for about 3 months straight and have not had a cold, feel wonderful, happier, and just plain better!  Goji is a daily supplement and really does aid in immune support, so taking it for that is worth it.  You just have to give it a chance to work.  There are never really any overnight miracle cures for anything.  The good stuff that really works takes time and you have to make it part of your everyday lifestyle to see the real benefit.  I have even planted my own Goji berry plants, so I can eat the fruit as well.<br /><br />This is the best price of all the Goji sold.  You can get it straight from Genesis today or from amazon for the same price, give or take a dollar.  Don't waste money on the white plastic bottle type sold under several names because it is mostly made of other fruit juices and is not pure Goji concentrate.  This is pure with no juices and is well worth the price.  Just remember that to see the real benefits you have to make it part of your lifestyle and it will work.  It is not called the ""happy juice"" for nothing.  It is even used over seas to help ease the after affects of that patients get when taking chemotherapy.  Just remember that sometimes in America we take something that works and blow it up by exaggerating the cost, adding stuff to the original, and not really informing the consumers on the proper way to use it.  This again is the only real 100% totally pure Goji juice and the only one worth spending money on other than growing ur own fruit trees."

Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"

The potato bread mix actually rose and stuck to the top of my bread making machine and became entangled in the mixing blade, so it was difficult to remove.  Otherwise, the bread tasted great!!  The Rye bread was also delicious.  It didn'nt rise as much, and I had no trouble removing it from the bread machine.  The rye loaf was much denser than the potato bread loaf.<br /><br />The only drawback to purchasing these products online was the shipping costs.  I have since found out that I can purchase the same brand products at HEB and Kroger grocery stores, and will not order online, again."

The small, round design means you'll fit a lot of these into a typical training pouch, so you won't run out.

Got to reading about the products.  Sodastream seems to be so proud that they did not include aspartame in their diet products, and used only sugar in their non-diet products (Instead of high fructose corn syrup).  However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.  My Sodastream is going back to the company with a message stating that if I wanted diet pop I would buy it myself, and they should only put sugar in regular soda.  They brag about real sugar, and then hide artifical sweetner in every product hoping no one will notice.  It shows in the bad taste of their regular sodas, and, in my opinion, does not make them a very reputable company.  Buyer beware."

There are very good articles on line, that explain how MSG can be ""hidden"", in the list of ingredients.  The articles indicate there are over 40 food ingredients besides ""monosodium glutamate"" that contain processed free glutamic acid (MSG). It appears that autolyzed yeast extract and maltodextrin are two of those food ingredients.  In addition, ""NO MSG ADDED"" does not mean that there is NO MSG in the product. If MSG is ""processed into"" a product as opposed to being ""poured into"" a product (just a matter of a different processing method), then a company can declare ""NO MSG ADDED""  or ""NO ADDED MSG"", even though the product contains MSG.<br />Therefore, before I make an additional purchase,  I am asking Superior Touch --- Please advise if your Better Than Bouillon products actually contain any MSG."

One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of ""calms"" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not ""crispy"" cookies, or the blurb would say ""crispy,"" rather than ""chewy.""  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order."

It is amazing how well hemp matches with whey (and soy) in the amino acid profile and even though the protein content is less per serving--I get equivalent aminos from 15g of hemp that I do with 26g of whey or soy.

I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.

Even on Amazon and a well rated product, part of me just wonders if I am wasting money taking the chance on not liking an item.<br /><br />This Soup was outstanding. It has some spice, but not overpowering. The couscous is not pearled and chunky, nor is it overly sweet. The lentils are nice and mushy when cooked. I find one cup to be a little stingy (or I like this soup a lot) so I usually eat 2 in one sitting for lunch to up my fiber and keep my appetite at bay till dinner. They are a bit high on sodium, but if you are like me and don't eat too much sodium to begin with this should not be a big issue.<br /><br />One cup is 200 calories with only 15 from fat. The meals is light on sugar with only 5 grams and a decent 4 grams in dietary fiber, 10 of protein. So I think all in all this is a pretty decent quick meal for those who want to stay away from fast food or the vending machine.

114174,B004FELBH8,A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,"Tracy Rowan ""dargelos""",3,4,5,1303603200,Clear winner,"Generally speaking I find that the changes companies make on classic snacks are really more about grabbing more shelf space for the company than really producing appealing product.  The family of Oreos is a good example, with the originals being the only really tasty family member.  And as a fan of Fig Newtons, I have to say I was skeptical about these new fruit thins, but what the heck, right?<br /><br />Well these things are really good.  Like original Newtons, part of their appeal is that they're not icky sweet.  If anything, these new fruit thins are even less sweet than Newtons, and the sweetener is sugar, not hfcs.  You may or may not care about that.  I think it's important.  What's also important is that a deal of the sweetness, as with Newtons, comes from the fruit.<br /><br />While the cookie itself is made with white flour, it does boast 2g of fiber from the addition of some rolled oats in addition to the dried fruit.  The result is a crisp cookie that has a nice, fruity flavor and no nasty aftertaste.  There are three large cookies to a serving at 140 calories.  That's not a bad snack, really, when you consider how little you get in most of those 100 calorie packs of cookies.<br /><br />This is perhaps not the most wholesome snack you can eat, but you could do far worse, nutritionally, and unless you like the uber sweet, artificial-tasting cookies that flood the supermarket shelves, you'll probably really enjoy the new Newton fruit thins."

When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K-cups that I could find.  I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my ""go-to"" coffee, but I didn't stop there.  I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new.  I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:<br /><br />After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand.  However, I will keep looking for something new.

If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says.

340795,B008JHROIM,A2BLFCOPSMBOZ9,"David Edmiston ""Dave""",0,0,5,1346025600,Good stuff!,"We like to add some heat to our meals in my family.  We all grew up in Southern California where the spiciness of Mexican food is a big part of our diet.  We use a lot of powders in our recipes:  Since we like the taste of smokey peppers, we use a lot of chipotle powder when we cook.  We don't use as many bottled pepper sauces though, because they're usually either boring and disappointing (like the same-old-same-old you get from Tabasco) or they're insanely hot.  I like heat in my food, but I don't like the stupidity of the heat that you find in some of the smaller brands.  Those sauces seem to be designed for &uuml;ber macho guys who are compensating for something.<br /><br />So my fridge has half used bottles of Tabasco, Tapatillo, Chalupa, etc.  We use them sometimes, but never with much enthusiasm.  We usually turn to those sauces when we're too lazy to spice things up right or when we're out of a better ingredient.  With that in mind, I wasn't too eager to open up another bottle of hot sauce.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I don't know what I love more, what this IS or what it ISN'T.<br /><br />First of all, what this sauce IS, is an incredible balance between flavor and heat.  I wouldn't exactly call this ""mild"", but it's not overpoweringly hot at all.  It's a great way to add some spicy flavor to an unspiced food.  It also has a unique flavor all of its own that is really good.  The main ingredient (and the source of the color) is carrots.  That might sound weird, but it works very well.  There is also a strong layer of citrus that catches your attention right away (in a good way).  And probably best of all, what you don't taste is any vinegar.  I get so tired of the overwhelming vinegar flavor from Tabasco sauce that it really makes me discriminate against the entire category of bottled hot sauces.  Luckily the flavor of Tabanero is good enough that I can overcome this bias.<br /><br />Here's what I've tried it on so far:<br /><br />*  First of all, I just wanted to taste it but I didn't want to wreck a meal.  I decided just to sample it on something I already had in the fridge.  I was in a hurry and lazy (but curious), so I just grabbed a slice of deli cheddar cheese and shook a bunch of this on it.  I was really surprised and definitely hooked.<br /><br />*  Next I tried it on some grilled chicken.  I put it on the chicken while it was on the grill and then I put some more on once it was on my plate.  It changed the chicken to something else and it really created a new variety.  My grilled chicken has always been very good, but this made it even better.<br /><br />*  I also tried it on some pizza.  We got one of those take-home, bake it yourself Walmart pizzas.  They're pretty mediocre pizzas, but they're cheap and they require absolutely zero brain cells too cook (we were tired and it had been a long weekend already).  As I grabbed the bottle, I had to stop myself and ask what it was that I was trying to accomplish:  Was I about to drown this pizza with hot sauce so I'd kill my taste buds and not have to taste the pizza?  Because with enough of this sauce, that was definitely an option.  Or was I going to apply just enough to transform this pizza into something better and turn it into something delicious.  I decided to try for option #2 and see if it was possible.  If that didn't work, I could always escalate things and add more sauce.  I was really surprised though.  By adding just enough Tabenero sauce, I ended up really enjoying this lousy pizza and turning it into something that I was happy to be eating (except for the obvious nutritional shortcomings).<br /><br />Bottom line:  I don't like most pepper sauces, but I LOVE this Tabenero sauce.  When this bottle is gone, I'll buy a couple more so I'll have some in the fridge and a backup bottle in the pantry.  And I'll probably toss out some of those other bottles from the fridge, because they don't serve a purpose anymore.<br /><br />I was provided this item for review (thank you!!!)."

I found these on an Amazon Manager's Special, for slightly less than $2/box and the ingredients were healthy and intriguing - with the 5 seed combination, and two of my favorites - rosemary and garlic. Since there were no reviews, I didn't really know what to expect, but I had to give these a try.<br /><br />First of all, they are very fresh & crunchy. The ""sell by"" date is 11/02/09 - 2 months away. They're cute, little, 1.5"" round ""crackers"", really tortilla chips. As a tortilla chip, these are the best I've ever had. They are very sturdy, you could use them to scoop anything, including the thickest guacamole, and I don't think they would break or crumble. The delicious taste I got from the first one with all of the nuances of every flavor, unfortunately diminishes, where the rosemary and garlic isn't really discernible, but you still get that wonderful corn (organic!) & seeds flavor with just the right amount of salt - way lower than most with 50mg. I don't know if that is considered a low sodium product, but many snacks and processed foods, like most jerky and a lot of crackers are way too salty for me.<br /><br />FYI Nutrition info:<br />Serving Size 1oz / about 16 crackers (28g) - 4 servings/box<br />Calories 140<br />Total Fat 7g - Saturated Fat 1g - No Trans Fat<br />Cholesterol 0<br />Total Carbs 18g<br />Fiber 2g<br />Sugars 0<br />Protein 2g<br />Sodium 50g<br /><br />BTW, they are gluten free, which is really important for a lot of people.<br />Most of the crackers in the box I opened were intact with a few broken ones mostly at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />Even though they are perfect on their own, they would be really good with a black bean dip, guacamole or hummus.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you're looking for a tasty and healthy snack cracker/chip, these are for you!"

Most people are so consumed with sugar and fat grams and they don't even think about fiber. Most people don't have a clue of the fiber content of the foods they eat or even how much they need per day. But they can tell you how many fat grams and carbs things have!<br /><br />The average adult needs 25-30 grams of fiber per day. It's not just about staying regular, it's all about beating the odds against colon cancer.<br /><br />Fiber also helps blood sugar stay regulated by slowing down digestion which keeps your insulin steady.<br /><br />Thanks to fiber one for making these great products. I no longer have to take icky fiber supplements! Colon cancer runs in my family as well as Type 2 diabetes and high fiber products like this are a blessing to me."

Because this pasta is so very flavorful, I enjoy it best with a good quality olive oil and some Celtic sea salt. Sometimes I add some tarragon or fresh rosemary, usually not, so I can just savor the pasta alone. It also is excellent with olive oil and fresh grated Parmesan chees on top.<br /><br />With only 1g of fat, 10g of sodium, this can also be a heart-healthy meal.

It's very expensive and I thought I was giving my puppy the best. Wrong.<br />My pup has had bad gas all this time but I did not think it was due to the dog food. We just thought he was eating too fast. Then when he was 4 months, he got very sick.. throwing up and loose stools. We took him to the vet for x-rays just to be sure there was no obstruction. There was not. He got better but the gas continued.<br />About 2 weeks ago, my dog started vomiting his Wellness food a few hours after eating. It looked whole. He was not holding down any of his meals and this went on for a week! We took him back to the vet for x-rays and even an mri.. the vet found nothing. We took him off the Wellness and gave him chicken and rice.. he was fine... started mixing in Wellness again and he got sick. Took him off and we are giving him ground beef and brown rice.. he has not thrown up once.<br />Yesterday, we received a call from our friend who adopted Saki's brother. His brother has been on Wellness for the past week and guess what-- same exact symptoms as my dog!!<br />To me, this is sure proof of the Wellness being the culprit.<br />This morning, I researched this food more.. just type in a search engine- ""Wellness Super5mix sick"" and you will be sick when you read all of the cases of illness due to this product!

I had read the reviews and I knew that it wouldn't cook a lot at a time, so I wasn't expecting to make mass quantities of babyfood, just to make it easier to give my daughter whatever veggies we might be eating that night.  Well I'm pretty dissapointed -- almost everything I've tried in isn't as cooked as it needs to be.  I find the machine to puree the food when it's half raw, resulting in a lumpy mess.  I've tried mixing the food with breastmilk and pureeing it further, and then it just tastes like raws veggies pureed with breast milk.  Gross.  I have also tried cooking the food for longer than the recommended times, but I guess the steam isn't strong enough, because it's never cooked enough.  I've tried sweet potatoes, green beans and carrots, all with disastrous results.

So the questions as to what one might get in quantity for the price is answered for the positive.<br /><br />Then we get to the taste and this is as good as anything one can find with prepackaged chocolate.  The texture is rich and creamy and the taste sweet without being overbearingly so.  There are hints of caramel in the flavor but more in the background and integrated into the chocolate rather than as filling.  It achieves an exquisite balance and manages to produce one of the upper echelon milk chocolate bars on the market.  Those who like their chocolate more on the heavier and/or bitter side might not be as impressed but then they would probably avoid the milk chocolate genre entirely.  If their achievement here is any indication, they likely would have other high quality products to satisfy such preferences.<br /><br />Schaffen-Berger Milk Chocolate is not a bar to be eaten quickly but one to be savored slowly.

I was expecting more of a coconut taste and was surprised to find it rather bland but my primary purpose of usage is supplementation so it doesn't bother me that it's plain. The amount of potassium in 1 single serving literally almost compares to the amount of potassium in a serving of fresh coconut water. I can double the fun and add both together for a super boost! I have no interest in the flavored varities but I'm sure they offer more taste than the original - for those who feel they need added flavor.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

Phillips,6,8,5,1339113600,Your taste buds will thank you!,"I was pleased to win a sampler box of Brooklyn Bean Roastery's eight most popular varieties (2 of each) in a contest promotion, and I can't say enough wonderful things about this ambitious new company's offerings.  From what I read here in early reviews, they got off to a shaky start with quality control in the manufacturing of the K-cups, but rest assured that I experienced no problems whatsoever.  The quality of the coffee is top notch, and the blend variety is mesmerizing.  It's SO good, in fact, that it's really hard to pick favorites, which is why I think that the most brilliant thing Brooklyn Bean could do, is offer a VARIETY PACK!  After all, not every one wants the same exact coffee, cup after cup.  Variety is what makes life interesting, does it not?<br /><br />Brooklyn Bridge Blend was the first one I tried, and my personal favorite.  It's a delightful medium roast that delights any time of day or evening, with just the right balance of body and flavor.  If I had to choose one coffee to drink for the rest of my life, THIS would be the one.<br /><br />Breakfast Blend paled in comparison, being a light roasted coffee, and initially not a standout for me.  But, my wife thought it was stellar, and could easily be a daily, easy-drinking morning favorite, even though she usually prefers darker, stronger roasts.<br /><br />Their Colombian is by far the BEST Colombian I have ever had, very complex in taste with sweet and nutty undertones.  Start your day with this, and you'll have a happy day.<br /><br />French Roast is usually not high on my list, but Brooklyn's is astounding!  It doesn't display the bitterness that I usually find with other French Roasts, and makes an excellent dark roast after dinner coffee.<br /><br />Boardwalk Blend is a medium roast, extra bold, that is best made in a larger size cup, 10 or 12 oz, and is also excellent over ice!  It won't knock you out, because it's not overwhelming in any one character, but it's a pleasant, drinkable blend.<br /><br />Corner Donut Shop is unique, in that it's not like any other company's ""donut shop"" blends for the Keurig type machines.  The flavor is a bit more subtle, and compliments pastries, pies, donuts (of course) any time of day.  This is a relaxing coffee, not one to shake you up, which is a good thing sometimes.  Think of it as the ""comfort food"" of coffees.  Medium roast, extra bold, make this in a larger size cup, also.<br /><br />Cyclone, named for the iconic Coney Island roller coaster, is a kick in the pants coffee.  Strong, bold, daring and a thrill-ride of complex, intense flavors, circling your palette, with each sip being a new thrill ride.  Yes, you'll want to ride again!  My wife has called this the ""Guinness of coffees"", with chocolaty undertones and full-bodied texture.  Definitely make this in a larger cup, being both a dark roast and an extra bold cup.<br /><br />A Brooklyn uniqueness, Fuhgeddaboudit, is another dark roast extra bold blend that leaves no doubt in your mind that you're drinking a cup of COFFEE!  This will wake you up out of a coma, folks!  Only in New York could they possibly come up with something this brash, cosmopolitan and interesting.<br /><br />I rarely drink decaf, but would like to try BB's, and feel the same about flavored coffees, like their Maple, Hazelnut and Vanilla offerings.  But, in short, we're so fond of Brooklyn Bean coffees, all of them so far, that it really is a tough choice to shop for a 36 count box of any one blend.  This is why it would be astounding, if they offered for sale, variety packs!  Keep up the great work, Brooklyn, I predict that this will soon be the #1 K-cup coffee on the planet!"

The ingredients were organic, these was a decent fiber content, and most importantly, there was no corn or sugar.  Recently General Mills (company that owns Cascadian Farms)decided to covertly change the formula, add a bunch of sugar and corn, and pass it off as the same cereal.  I opened the box and thought that that there was a packaging mix-up.  I thought they put the Honey O's in the Purely O's box.  I called the customer service number (which I have never done before) to let them know.  To my surprise I was told that it was not a mixup, and that they had changed the formula.  I was stunned.  I had finally found a fortified cereal without all of the junk in it that I liked.  Now it is just another overpriced mainstream sugar cereal.  Obviously General Mills is trying to maximize profits by cheapening the ingredients in their line of foods.  Poor form in my opinion.  I agree with the other reviews.  At the very least, inform people.  They have lost me as a Purely O's customer, and I question whether or not I can trust the brand in general.  Don't bother with this cereal.

468892,B0013Z40U2,A18AAABCIJKC5Q,Rhiever,0,5,2,1295740800,High fiber isn't necessarily a good thing!,"I recently cut fiber one bars out of my diet after I noticed that I get all the fiber I need in a day just by eating whole wheat bread, fruits, vegetables and nuts. If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a ""healthy"" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision.

The olives (and other ingredients) are shipped without any brine which makes long-term storage a challenge.  I had to make my own brine since if you leave the olives without any brine they get even mushier and spoil.  I re-packaged them in a plastic container and made a brine of sea salt and water (which is a standard olive brine) and they are storing well after 6 months.  Yes, I made them even saltier but at least they will last indefinately this way.  Make sure to use enough sea salt or they will spoil.

All of them taste natural because they are..they are not sweet and the fruit flavors are really only the essence of the flavor itself and are quite subtle tasting.<br /><br />I can't think of a better or more healthy drink...in fact because of its potassium content, I consider it a better drink than plain water.

The company has not publicized the risk of blockage and choking, and 13 dogs have died as a result of ingesting Greenies. Try googling ""Greenies"" and ""blockage"" or ""death."" This product is not safe for dogs.<br /><br />I was sent a free sample of the ""reformulated"" Greenie in the mail. The package claims the treat is ""easier to digest"", so I gave the treat to my dog, a 100 pound weimaraner. I watched my dog chew the treat, and he chewed it appropriately, taking his time to chew the pieces into small, digestible chunks.<br /><br />The next day, my dog refused to eat or drink anything and vomited at least three times. He acted listless and lethargic all day, so that evening we called our vet. We told the vet that the last thing our dog ate was a Greenie. The vet informed us that Greenies are known to cause intestinal blockage in some cases. He suggested that we take him to the emergency vet clinic for advanced treatment.<br /><br />We took him to the emergency clinic for x-rays and diagnosis. The vet treated him with an anti-vomiting medication and told us to return if he continued to vomit. The cost of this visit was approximately $400.<br /><br />The next day, we woke up to find our dog covered in bloody soft stool. He has had three bouts of diarreha in two hours, all of it soft and bloody. We called our vet and he told us that the dog was experiencing severe intestinal distress, which was causing the bloody stool. He suggested we give him water and return to the clinic in the early a.m.<br /><br />Thankfully, our dog passed the Greenie through his body. Had he not passed the Greenie, he would have required exploratory surgery, which my vet estimates will cost approximately $3,000, depending on the nature of the blockage.<br /><br />The representation that the new, reformulated Greenie is ""easier to digest"" is patently false. Our dog properly chewed the Greenie, but yet the treat was still insoluble and indigestible. His ingestion of the Greenie caused serious health issues. These things aren't safe -- please don't support this company or put your dog's health at risk."

The usual slim paper packet has been replaced by a slightly more bulky thickened packet to preserve the nutrient content, but otherwise the product can be used in the same manner as the original item.<br /><br />The nutrient 'boost' is only 20% of the RDA value of B-1, B-5 and B-6, all water soluble vitamins, so there is little worry of toxic overdose of the vitamins in a healthy person (although, 1,000mg/day of B-6 has been cited as a toxic level, it is unlikely that you would ingest enough without recourse to multiple bottles of B supplement tablets). B vitamins are associated with healthy metabolism, hair, skin, immune and nervous systems.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not the full complement of B vitamins, neglecting several key members: riboflavin (B-2), niacin (B-3), folic acid (B-9) and cyanocobalamin (B-12). The addition of a few B vitamins is a nice little value-add to the product, but does not replace my B Complex supplement.

I didn't have a problem with this and I used the wash on body and face.<br /><br />My main goal is to get clean, and it worked for that.  I'm not that concerned with scent, but I don't particularly want to smell flowery, so I'd rather use a product aimed at men.  I'd also prefer not to have my skin dry out, so I liked that this wash contained moisturizing elements.<br /><br />I also like shower gels and washes that come in ease tubes rather than messy bar soap that I used for so many years.  These are just more convenient and less messy.  Bottom line:  I felt clean after using it, my skin felt good, and it's easy to use.  It's a product I'll use."

Then, I decided to try the Soulistic brand of pure shredded chicken in gravy. This is a cat who wouldn't even eat boiled chicken and he inhaled this!  It has to be a texture thing with him because he hated pates and gelees. Now, after a year on the Soulistic plain chicken in gravy (He still won't touch the chicken with pumpkin!)he has decided to include the chicken and tuna in gravy.  We are delighted to have found a healthy diet for our cat at such an affordable price for a generous 5.5 ounce can.  One other company has offered a similar product but offers a 2.2 ounce can at a much higher price.  I agree that the chicken and tuna has more gravy than the plain chicken formula with gravy, but we feel that it provides a good balance in his diet by using the two varieties."

After being on medication for some time for unpleasant heart palpitations (which never worked too well), I decided to give this supplement a try. In about 2 months, the palpitations were completely gone, and I don't have to take that horrible drug anymore! This stuff is awesome. This was about a year ago. I have come to realize that doctors know nothing about caring for the human body and know very little about real nutrition. Your just a customer to them; they make their money by prescribing dangerous drugs that only mask symptoms but don't correct the problem at its source. Magnesium is so important for the body - you cannot go wrong with this supplement. Most people are deficient in this important mineral because the land is so devoid of important minerals these days, so it's very hard to get from food alone. This is the best magnesium supplement on the market. Don't take those cheap magnesium pills you can get at any store. Most of them don't get absorbed by the body and act only as a laxative. Magnesium citrate, of which this product is, gets assimilated easily. Don't be surprised if other problems your having begin to clear up as well. Magnesium deficiency can cause a lot of problems.

I highly recommend this sauce.<br /><br />How much pizza can you make with one can?<br /><br />If you are making one 16"" round pizza you will likely have extra sauce unless you lay it on extra thick. On an 18"" round pizza the sauce still covers nicely but you might not have any left over for dipping.<br /><br />I typically make a single 12"" diameter pizza and I like to lay the sauce on thick. One can is more than enough for two of these pizzas, which causes a left-over problem. Another reviewer suggests freezing the extra but that requires advanced planning to account for thaw time and I'm a guy so I never plan that far ahead.<br /><br />Some calculations:<br /><br />I figure one ounce of sauce can thickly cover about 15 sq inches of pizza. This is based on my experience with 12"" diameter pizzas:<br /><br />... 12"" diameter = 113 sq in<br />... 2 pizzas @ 113 sq in each = ~15 sq in per ounce<br /><br />15 ounces @ 15 sq in per ounce means one can is enough sauce for 225 sq in of coverage, or about one 17"" diameter round pizza. But who makes 17"" round pizzas?<br /><br />If each ounce covers 15 sq in of pizza, one 15oz can will cover ...<br /><br />* one 18"" dia round pizza (255 sq in) @ 0.059 ounce / sq in, nicely covered<br />* one 16"" dia round pizza (201 sq in) @ 0.075 ounce / sq in, extra thickly covered<br />* two 12"" dia round pizzas (226 sq in) @ 0.066 ounce / sq in, thickly covered<br />* one 15""x15"" square pizza (225 sq in) @ 0.066 ounce / sq in, thickly covered<br />* one 13""x18"" baker's half sheet (234 sq in) @ 0.064 ounce / sq in, thickly covered<br />* two 9""x13"" quarter sheet pans (234 sq in) @ 0.064 ounce / sq in, thickly covered<br /><br />By ""thickly covered"" I mean the sauce oozes when you take a bite. If you like to spread the sauce thinly you will have extra for dipping. Bonus!<br /><br />For my twelve inch pizza-making purposes a 7 or 8oz can would be ideal but I'm not going to stop buying the 15 ounce cans. I'll just have to eat more pizza.<br /><br />By the way, if you like pepperoni, I highly recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JW96I"">Bridgford Pepperoni, Old World, 16-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 3)</a>.

Unfortunately, that flavor has never been available in my area for some reason, so I usually order it online or buy several shakers whenever I travel somewhere that does have it. When I saw this popcorn at a local grocery store, I bought a box in hopes that it would taste like the seasoning I like so much. It doesn't really, but it's still pretty good. It is much less salty tasting than the popcorn seasoning, which is a good thing, but the herbs definitely overwhelm the other flavors. If I were naming the product or designing the box, I'd have put ""Italian herbs"" first on the label rather than ""Parmesan"". It's still good, just puts the emphasis on an unexpected flavor.<br /><br />The popcorn pops nicely using my microwave's popcorn button and tastes very fresh. The flavoring always seems to coat the popcorn evenly, unlike some flavored popcorns I've had in the past where the flavoring only seems to be on one side of the bag, leaving some of the popcorn plain. I also like the fact that the box includes whole-bag nutritional information for the popcorn, unlike so many brands that require you to do several calculations to figure out what you're eating. At 360 calories a bag, this popcorn is a reasonable snack and healthier than many other options. I'll keep buying it from time to time even though it wasn't exactly what I was hoping it would be."

They don't have a lot of competition, as I found out in my search for naturally-flavored candies. But they do offer a lot of flavors. YummyEarth offers 19 flavors of hard candies, 12 of which are fruit. I was looking for fruit, so I bought this ""family size"" (13 oz) ""Freshest Fruit"" assortment of Organic Candy Drops. It contains approximately 115 hard candies in 8 fruit flavors: watermelon, blueberry, apple, pomegranate, mango, blood orange, strawberry, and cherry. The candies are vegan, gluten-free, all-natural, and certified organic. They are sweetened with organic evaporated sugar cane juice (also known as Sucanat or Florida Crystals), organic tapioca syrup and/or organic rice syrup. Five candies (one serving) contain 70 calories and 17g carbohydrates.<br /><br />The first trick is to figure out which color is which flavor. It doesn't say on the bag, so here's a key:<br /><br />Wet-Face Watermelon: pink<br />Too Berry Blueberry: white/red<br />Sour Apple Tart: chartreuse<br />Pomegranate Pucker: dark red (white writing on wrapper)<br />Mango Tango: yellow/gold<br />Blood Orange Cocktail: red/gold<br />Strawberry Smash: red/pink<br />Very Very Cherry: dark red (blue writing on wrapper)<br /><br />As expected, the natural flavors are a lot better than artificial fruit flavors. Nothing could be worse than artificial strawberry flavor. YummyEarth's strawberry is a little more tart than a real strawberry. Watermelon also tastes of watermelon at first, but there is a second burst that is tart. They still taste good, but there is some room for improvement, as those are both naturally sweet flavors. I was surprised by the blueberry, because I don't like blueberries, but I like this candy. The blood orange and mango tasted to me the most like the fresh fruit. I was especially impressed by the blood orange candies. I expected them to taste like generic orange, but they really taste like blood orange. Mango is very fruity as well. Most of YummyEarth's fruit flavors are available only in big single bags, but this is a good sampler. Something for everyone. I only wish they made a citrus assortment."

In order of effectiveness, I'd rank them as 3- pump,  2-nitrogen gas, and 1-wine shield. We used to use the pump, then switched to gas. With gas, we'd get 2 or more days out of a bottle depending on the wine. Whites can go a lot longer, but some reds would taste a little different after a day with gas. But with the wine shield, I have gone 4 days or so with very little change in red wines. We refrigerate them after opening and warm them up when ready to drink. The only issue I've found with the wine shield is it doesn't fit as well in some gewurztraminer bottles which are narrower, but gawurz keeps pretty well anyway, so we just use gas for those. We are regular wine drinkers, and polishing off one bottle a night between 2 people leaves me a little fuzzy the next day, and can get pricey. We usually drink a half bottle with dinner, and pair our wines, so we may have 3 open bottles at a time. This has been a great solution, and after 2 10 packs I am sold. I just went for the 130 pack."

I did find that it took some major degassing, and be careful with that because it can spew right out of the carboy. This wine has the gas!  I took an extra couple of days for this process.  I topped it off (head top) for the last weeks with a niagra to give it a bit of sweet, and I did add a wine conditioner...it is mostly for gifts so I went sweeter.  It does have a bite at bottle, but I expect that to grow sweeter by Christmas.  All in all it's quite ok to drink at finish if you are a bit on the dry side.  A point that may interest, I had a duh moment when starting this wine. I forgot to add the benonite.  It cleared on it's own beautifully with a few extra weeks.  It seems goof proof.  I'd say buy it if you like a nice white, no frills kind of wine to chill on that spur of the moment.  I am pretty sold on these kits for the price.

It's something of an adventure and a good way to exp[ore the coffees of the world.

Sometimes I still pop an ibuprofen if it's a bad month, but always having this tea on hand really makes a difference for me!<br /><br />I drink it throughout the month too, often in the winter because of the warming qualities, or when I feel stressed, because the muscle relaxant ingredients do help with that as well.

If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.  I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.

Do you know those things?  Starbucks sells like Mocha and Vanilla cold drink things - I have no idea what they are, precisely, but I know they are AWESOME.  So I figured this thing - this Cappuccino can thing - would be like that.  And to some degree, it is, only to a lesser degree.<br />-<br />First off, the can says Cappuccino, but it tastes like no cappuccino I ever had!  One of the ingredients is cocoa powder, and I'm pretty sure that's not an ingredient in cappuccino!  First ingredient is cream or milk - I forget - so just FYI this is a creamy-coffee drink - it's not like black coffee or anything.  It is very much like the Starbucks drinks I love, only it tastes more watery.  The starbucks drinks have that super-creamy and sweet and strong coffee flavor that punches you in the mouth!  This drink is more like being hit in the cheek with a slice of lemon.  No, it doesn't taste like lemon.  I'm trying to make this entertaining.  Is it working?  Anyhow - this drink is OK, but it's not GREAT.  I liked it well enough, but if I'm going to buy some pseudo-coffee drink in a can, I'll reach for the Starbucks bottle instead.<br />-<br />Also - I got a slight headache after drinking this.

Certainly they may be too sweet for some tastes, and I agree with another reviewer that for dunking into hot beverages the coating will melt. (But dunking into cold milk might be interesting.) In fact, keep them out of hot weather as the type of chocolate coating is not hard.<br />But for taste these are far superior to any Keebler, Nabisco, etc. cookie of this style and only cookies from small, quality bakeries can compare. If you can get your hands on a package and enjoy a crunchy, oaty, delicious cookie by all means give these a try.<br />What's most amazing is that even with the chocolate coating, the calories and fat are very low for a fairly large cookie, and each has 1 gm of fiber. I don't have all the numbers to array, but I am sure that the Hob Nobs would beat their commercial equivalents in all categories (not, of course, that you eat cookies for health!)<br />For price comparison: I paid $4 for a 9 oz tube in early 2009.

I felt pretty good the night before, but when I awoke I had shooting pains in my left hip extending to my testicle.  Well, I went to the Doctor and as all regular doctors do, he pretty much told me to take an Advil and get back to him.  Well, not only didn't it help, but he billed my insurance over $400!  After extensive google searches, I decided to check out a Chinese traditional physician, and after checking out my Chi flow and other such things I won't bother you with, he wrote some scribble on a note (it was Chinese) and when I asked him what it meant, he said ""RABBIT! You eat!"".  Aha! Perhaps this was the cure I was looking for, and decided to procure one.  Needless to say, Pet stores were pretty horrified at my request of ""One medicinal rabbit"", and sent me on my way.  The next thing I tried was going out in the woods to hunt a rabbit.  But let me tell you, they are pretty FAST!  After trying many methods, such as a home-made spear, rocks, and just trying to chase it through the woods, not only did I not catch a rabbit, my Left hip and testicle hurt more than ever!  Finally, I found this rabbit on Amazon, and despite it being more expensive than Kobe Beef, I decided, ""What the Heck!"" and ordered it up.  When it arrived, it did not look very appetizing, but I cooked it up in something called ""Hassenpfeffer"" and when I told my roomate, he just said, ""Whatever floats your boat, dude...carry on.""<br />I ate my rabbit while watching an old rerun of ""Man versus wild"" and went to bed with a full stomach but not much hope that rabbit meat would cure me.  However, within just a few days, my hip and testicle were as good as new, and I will never question Chinese medicine again.  I already have an order in for a tiger bone, which supposedly is amazing in the dept of virility.<br />Bravo, rabbit meat! Excelsior!"

The only problem is that Appetizers are small portions (2 ounces instead of 3.3 ounces), expensive (retailing at $1.49 per portion), and not a complete source of nutrition. Fancy Feast says the Appetizers should supplement regular cat food rather than replace it. But it's the one meal that gets my cat to clean his bowl.<br /><br />So when I discovered Soulistic cat foods being offered at Petco, I gave the Sweet Salutations Chicken and Tuna Dinner a try. More standard 3-oz can priced at 89 cents apiece, with complete feline nutrition. My incredibly picky cat will eat 90% of this. So it's a decent alternative to the Fancy Feast Appetizers that he craves.<br /><br />This particular canned meal has a lot of gravy, which pleases my cat but may not satisfy others who prefer more meat.<br /><br />Given Petco's shipping charges, I probably will continue to buy this at my local Petco rather than ship via Amazon.<br /><br />NOTE: The price shown here is for a tray of 12 cans."

But my experiment led me to discover the best method for using the handy little pods when no one cup maker is available.  When I saw that I had a pot of hot weak coffee I took the pods out of the basket and dropped them into the hot coffee.  I let them sit and steep for a while then plucked each pod out, squeezed, and discarded.  Now I had a good brew, as good as my first.  From then on when I use these pods I place one pod with about 8 oz of distilled water in a ten ounce mug and heat it good and hot in the microwave.  Remove from microwave and cover to retain heat while it brews.

I gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else's child would like it. I have had a good experience with the ""subscribe and save"" products in general, no broken jars and the quick delivery is great. I find that it is cheaper than whole foods (even with the coupons).

Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!"

But, overall, its a very good mix and easy to make.  There is some prep time involved with mincing garlic, onion, ginger, etc. But it's not hard to do.  You can also reduce the recipe by half and use half a package of seasoning (still use one whole can of tomato sauce but little or no water) and it comes out great.

Then a couple months ago, we thought we got a bad batch of the iced mocha and so we returned them and tried getting them locally in a store by us. Same horrific taste. At the same time, we were dropped from the auto ship program and it was getting harder to find it in the local stores in that flavor so we assumed they changed the formula but the Vitamin Shoppe had no idea and there was no indication on the packaging saying that there were any changes made. So, we tried switching to the chocolate fudge. It was delicious so we just changed our auto ship to the new flavor and for a couple months got by with the chocolate fudge. Then, we got dropped from the auto ship again and had a harder time finding it in the stores. Apparently, they changed the chocolate fudge formula also. I just got 2 new cases and they have that same DISGUSTING taste that the iced mocha had. Needless to say we can't drink it anymore, will be returning what we have and actively trying to find a replacement drink. I can't tell you how disappointed we are. All I can say is that unless they change the formula back, I'll never buy it again. It isn't even drinkable. It's absolutely revolting!"

I don't like stevia either.  I love the ingredients list on Orgain- organic whey & milk proteins!!, brown rice syrup to avoid that sugar crash, and a great blend of vegetables and fruits.  I can't even tell from drinking that it contains kale, beet, spinach, carrots, and tomatoes.  The 16g of protein per asceptic container is perfect and ideally sized.<br /><br />I purchase at least 5-6 cases of Orgain a month, because I drink 2-3 a day.  At least 1 as a post-workout shake, and the others as meal supplements.  Orgain also helps me stay awake at night for evening classes, and are more preferable to consuming Red Bull or 5-hour energy drinks.  I credit Orgain (along with a healthy diet) for helping me lose weight and pursue my fitness goals.<br /><br />Big fan of the sweet vanilla and chocolate flavors, was hoping to try the Cafe Mocha flavor, but Amazon didn't offer any with Prime shipping...until now!  The coffee flavor is delicious; there's a slight coffee-ish aftertaste, but I like it.  Its flavor profile lies somewhere between the more neutral vanilla and the stronger chocolate flavors.  There's also no caffeine in the Mocha varieties.  Unlike the vanilla flavor, I'm happy to report that the Mocha flavors do not seem prone to  whey protein aggregation.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and grab a Cafe Mocha Orgain!  Pop it in the fridge, and it'll be like drinking a nice iced coffee from Starbucks, but much healthier.  Just a final caveat; the Cafe Mocha flavor seems very popular, and frequently goes out of stock.  Buy it when you can!"

To them so confused I ask<br /><br />Cooking?<br /><br />Each day at least once a day, I draw forth my serrated knife, and one sacrificial box of this excellent tofu, and I without remorse slice a hole in its top, with great tenderness and care and gratitude, releasing only the slightest and most apologetic gentle spurt of clearest liquid.<br /><br />And this with a certain yearning.<br /><br />I do not observe the indications written sternly upon the short edge of the box, but lie this box gently down upon a smooth flat slab of wood, with the face up, and take the knife very gently sliding upon on edge of the top, the very belly of the box, and then upon the other edge of this top, and then most gently along the bottom edge of this top, each time releasing apologetically the slightest hint of a clear liquid, revealing thusly by means of these three slits the gentle hidden secrets of the box, the soft white substance lying shyly within, awaiting with embarrassment our further processing.<br /><br />I feel the need to explain this procedure with greater care and attention. The very tip, the point of the knife, uncovers tenderly a certain point a certain distance from the corner of the broad top of the box, the side with the picture and product label, as pictured here, the side which reads Morinu, the broad flat side laid flat. The very tip of the knife, I say, discovers probingly a certain point near one corner which offers the proper resistance without too great a resistance, without too little a resistance, to penetrate this membrane. Too close to the corner is found to be too hard, too resistant, too unwilling, although most convenient for the later proceedings. Too distant from the corner implies simply random slashings without specific purpose, and our purpose in this procedure is most serious, most purposeful, intent.<br /><br />In a word therefore the point of the knife penetrates the membrane slowly yet purposefully as close to the corner as possible, penetrating as deeply as possible without piercing the wooden slab beneath. A certain spurt of clear liquid may emerge, but let this prove no inhibition, as the knife reaches the depth of the box. Slowly withdraw the knife, slowly, at a diagonal, allowing the serration softly with friction to continue to separate a slight slit along the ege of the box, slowly, resolutely but patiently, with purpose, as the serration creates an ever longer slit along that edge, as closely as possible.<br /><br />Continue from this first slit along the the contiguous edge of the top of this box, and then the third edge, inserting carefully your knife, and slowly withdrawing with a friction sufficient to separate the membrane without shredding, without eliciting over muchly the clear liquid which may spurt forth.<br /><br />Let us call the top right corner of the box Point A, the bottom right corner Point B, the left bottom corner Point C and the upper left corner Point D. Begin to pierce at Point A, proceed in turn to B, to C, ending at D, forming this a slit along the three edges. Arriving at Point D, withdraw the knife completely, wipe the blade with a soft, dry cloth and set it aside for cleansing. We now may lift the flap thus created, exposing the delicate white contents within.<br /><br />I feel remiss if I do not address a probable misconception here writtenonly for the rhetorical convenience, and I feel compelled by the necesity of correcting this counter-indication, no matter how unclear this may be, due only to my severely limiting literary incapacities.<br /><br />Employing the same alphabetical coordinates as described above, the consumer may discover this procedure far more efficacious: to begin at Point A and proceed gently yet firmly to point B as described. Divergently, however, please proceed to point D (!) and then directly by knife edge to point C, parallel to the Line AB already created, yet along the opposing edge. Having thusly formed two parallel slits, find the midpoint between Point B and Point C as close to the edge as possible, probing and then plunging the tip of the knife through the cardboard membrane, through to the bottom of the box, but now with an orientation perpendicular to that previously used in the formation of lines AB and DC. Withdraw slowly, delicately, yet with sufficient friction at an angle to proceed effectively to the corner at Point B. Withdraw completely and reverse the knife blade, returning it deeply at the midpoint previously entered. Withdraw once more with similar care, and opposite diagonal, completing the slit thus formed entirely to Point C. I am confident the consumer may discover this procedure far more delightful and effective than any here previously described.<br /><br />Firmly we roll back the top flap created by the three slits. Proceed mercilessly, proceed, not frenetically, but ardently nevertheless, to dice within the selfsame box her contents, slowly, gently, but decisively. The fresh tip of my serrated knife, which in recent memory has touched no animal part, but vegetable alone, and never shall become so adulterate with the blood of the animal, with the dairy of the animal, this sanctified and reserved and faithful tip, having never known in any sense animal but only vegetable, purified thus, unadulterate, this sacred knife dares therefore pierce this gentle pure white tofu into a ruthless grid of slits, fully through to the bottom box, plunging first vertically in rhythmically repeated rows spaced gently a few centimeters apart, and then, relentlessly, horizontally, pushing ever so softly through the yielding, unresisting white tofu laid back upon the flat slab, awaiting without a word this process, with utter patience, yielding.<br /><br />Completed this repeated slicing, back and forth, up and down, across, and through, and through, I lift in one hand upwards the entire box gently, yet unrelentingly, over the recipient reserved for this purpose alone. Most often it is the daily lunch container, reusable, with soft top, to receive the more securely and gently this daily offering, removed demurely from its box, as cautiously as a hermit crab from its borrowed shell, vulnerable by exposure. With one finger one may remove whatever residue remains relunctly within the package, passing it reassuringly into the ultimate recipient.<br /><br />Lime juice freshly squeezed upon the tofu deposited there, as ablution, meets fragrant sprigs of fresh green cilantro mated with whole <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMFCRU"">Corriander Seeds 7oz</a>, and a generous ladling of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZU7QQ"">Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12)</a> also available upon this generously nutrient amazon. This is a meal in itself, and comes most welcome at noon.<br /><br />At night rather than such a cold lunch, in this cold winter a warmer meal is wanted, and so this gentle and yielding box of nutritious tofu might discover herself pushed gently into a saucepan of simmering miso soup, such as, perhaps, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RMB4WI"">Shiro Miso Paste NON GMO No MSG Added</a>. This miso soup would take far greater space to describe here in the making. From this container of miso paste draw forth a goodly spoonful to introduce slowly, most politely, into a gently heating small saucepan of water. Later, in place of seaweed and to deceive my own palate, I place those small flat spinach leaves available in the organic department of your local market, perhaps with the results of a small onion diced very carefully in the manner approved as described above, or green onion.<br /><br />When quite ready for dinner, I add last of all to this essence this gentle box of tofu, sliced as described above, with great and tender care, leaving it bathing one might dare say, only long enough to warm through and through, before eating.<br /><br />A veritable meal in itself.<br /><br />There are so many other manners in which to use, and to abuse, this pure, white and utterly nutritious gentle product, and I can only with my utmost recommendation say, and this with my greatest gratitude, that here at long last we may know a food most willingly fit for our human consumption, and one most readily available upon this wonderful amazon."

Although they are small, they are not as tiny as the berrybuddies we tried first (I don't even know what to do with those, they fall out at alarming rates from the buddy-toys hole).<br /><br />These - - he can chew, it's like he's eating peanut butter for a moment.  He doesn't just woof them down - he actually eats them.  I give him one at a time, and he sits and chews it for 10-20 seconds - much like peanut butter I would imagine.  They fit perfectly in the KONG toys (but not the busybuddy ones, they are smaller holes).<br /><br />The chicken ones were a bit too flavored for him - so I pinch them in half and add a few to his food - then he loves it - mixed with his food & warm water.  I want to try all the flavors!<br /><br />I also like that the company supports a cause with each bag purchased.  Very natural, very chewy little things, and my dog LOVES them.  Very good value.

Olstad,0,0,4,1347753600,"Health claims aside, it's a unique tasting water","There are a number of interesting studies surrounding alkaline water and its health benefits.  A google search can be hard to find a good source given the amount of salesmanship surrounding this type of product.  However, I felt the livestrong website had a well-sourced write up ([...]).  Having only had one bottle to sample, the long term benefits are not my concern for the purposes of this review.<br /><br />What I did notice right away was that this water does actually have a unique taste -- as subtle as water tastes can be.  I thought it was actually quite pleasant and clean -- certainly better than the filtered tap water that comes out of my fridge.  The electrolytes, which can sometimes have an oily taste, are undetectable.<br /><br />The hydration factor is noticeable to me.  I would go out on a limb and say that it may even surpass the hydration factor of electrolyte water on its own (which can be made easily by buying electrolyte packs to add to water).<br /><br />Now, is the hydration factor and *potential* long term health benefit something that's worth more than double the price of, say, Poland Spring?  That's up to you.  There's not a lot of information surrounding how much of this stuff you'd need to drink to see health benefits.  So using it as a long term product might get quite expensive.

Other than that the finished product is comparable to any Swiss Miss or other brand of powdered instant cocoa. It actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine. The largest setting makes it much too watery.<br /><br />Green Mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this.<br /><br />3 stars because it does make hot chocolate in your Keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches, but if you're looking for good hot chocolate, keep shopping."

When the rice cooker light tells me the rice is done, so is everything else!

I also consider it to be one of those kind of movies that could have come out only in the 80s (much like Labyrinth starring David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly).<br /><br />Beetlejuice deals with a recently deceased married couple, the Maitlands, who finds themselves essentially ""trapped"" in their former house for the next century or so. Unfortunately, this means living with the house's new owners, the Deetz. The Maitlands don't mind Deetz daughter Lydia played by Winona Ryder so much but her much more obnoxious parents and want to scare them away from the house. Their case worker tells them only one thing: to NEVER even think about recruiting her former assistant Beetlejuice. Unfortunately, they manage to resist for a while before giving in and Beetlejuice causes nothing but problems.<br /><br />It's definitely a work by Tim Burton. His ever-present ""uniqueness"" and charm is there. Beetlejuice is a fun 80s movie and a very fun watch period. the acting by everyone involved in the movie is great (especially Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice). The make-up for the necessary characters were well done and the ""afterlife"" set designs and make-up there were great. I loved the make-up and designs in the afterlife scenes.<br /><br />The movie itself is great and I would have given it five stars. The blu-ray as a whole leaves a little to be desired. It's one of those DVDs or blurays that pretty much leaps right into the movie. No title screen, scene selection, anything. This was a bit annoying since I had to manually go skip through the whole movie to get back to where I left off the night before. There's a small handful of special features that you may or may not be interested in. The special features are only three episodes of the cartoon series (of which I watched as a kid) and an audio track. The special features it does have really aren't that bad, I would have just liked to have had more. Like some sort of commentary, deleted scenes, or something.<br /><br />All in all, five stars for movie itself and three for the blu-ray (averaging four stars)."

They make just about any food, veggie, dairy product, or spice in either a freeze dried or powdered form.  As an outdoor enthusiast that enjoys carrying along a little taste of home into the savage wilderness, this is a company that I am well familiar with.  Not everything they make is delicious, or worth it. My experience with them however is that most of their products are just about the finest, and many times the only ones around.  This cheddar cheese powder is definitely one of their best.  Many reviewers here mention making macaroni and cheese, and popcorn with it.  Although I have used it for those purposes like everyone else, I have also used this powder as an addition to many soups that call for cheese, or grated cheese. (It makes a very flavorful substitute for grated cheese in many recipes.) Hamburger and sausage soups are a good example.  Many times I have concocted delicious one pot meals using this powder while out in the wilds on a hike, or camping. They are remembered as some of the best meals I have ever had. It is also very good when sprinkled on home made pizza, and I have an excellent recipe that includes this powder, butter, flour, and salt, that makes a delicious cheese spread for crackers and super bowl parties. Barry Farms cheddar powder is strong and flavorful, and a little goes a long ways.  A one pound bag will get you through many a recipe and outdoor adventure.  However since the shipping on this is a little high, (and the powder so reasonable) I suggest buying two pounds or more at once and storing it in a good air tight container.  You will save a lot on the shipping, and this powder will last for months if stored correctly.  I highly recommend this cheddar powder for those that enjoy the simple pleasures of popcorn and mac and cheese, as well as the more adventurous among us in the kitchen, and over an open fire..."

This tea does remind me of Earl Grey in flavor and aroma, only it has a more intense flavor.  If you like cream and sugar in your tea, this is a good match because it keeps a strong tea flavor without being overpowered (as some weaker black teas are). If you prefer light bodied teas like chamomille without cream or milk, this may not appeal to you.<br /><br />I have never had Taylors of Harrogate before now, but took a chance because I prefer loose tea to tea bags.  My local stores only sell two kinds of Twinings brand of loose tea, English Breakfast and Earl Grey. I prefer more variety.  This was a good buy for the price.  Since the tea is so intense, it doesn't take much to make a good cup.  I don't drink tea every morning, so this should last me a few months.

In addition, there's not much of a difference between these ""Mushy Yummy"" meals and the ""Creamy Yummy"" baby foods.  The ""Mushy"" baby food is more of a coarse puree than actual textured food.  Therefore, this may not be the ideal baby food for helping your baby learn to eat textured solid foods.  Perhaps this ""Mushy Yummy"" food may prove useful as in ""in-between"" step if your little-one is having trouble transitioning from smooth purees to textured baby food.  Otherwise, you might was well save yourself the money, time and trouble involved in purchasing, storing and heating up frozen ""live"" baby food, and go with a shelf-stable, organic brand like Plum Organics, Ella's Kitchen or Happy Baby.<br /><br />A final, albeit minor point.

Medium body, flavorful: the black tea is perfectly balanced with hints of the bergamot & jasmine. The bergamot is non-intrusive (I say this because sometimes tea makers go overboard with it) yet still there, subtle in the background; the jasmine makes the aroma very appealing. It has an almost sweet aftertaste.<br /><br />Make sure to use boiling water since it's a black tea and don't oversteep, or it'll get bitter. (Take the teabag out of your cup after about 2-4 min. depending on how you like it, but no longer.) Suggested brew time is 4 min. I like 2-3 min since it's a fast-steeping tea. You can prime the leaves for steeping by pouring hot water over the bag in the cup first and then immediately throwing that water out. This will allow  some water to soak into the leaves and help them start to release their oils & aroma (also known as ""Chinese rinsing,"" this gets out some of the caffeine). Or, if you you like a darker brew you could just shake the bag up and down in your cup in the first few seconds so all the surface of the leaves have contact with water. Whichever."

10031,B001CGTN1S,A1ZWM7T7R6MO02,JoshuaRM,12,13,5,1298592000,#1 superfood,"Nutritional benefits of Chia seeds are amazing. Here are a few to start:<br /><br />*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of ""steel cut"" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of chia powder, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.  I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days.  One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles.  But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon!  Could the Chia have helped?  I think so.  I certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when ""on"" the Chia.<br /><br />I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Chia powder, but have since started buying them on Amazon for a fraction of the price. My suggestion is to get some Chia and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible."

It still gets five stars because I found the quality, packaging, and ease of preparation to be great.

Why? Because it tastes like chili. Oh, there's a subtle hint of spice and the quality definitely sets it apart from Hormel, but for all intents and purposes, it tastes like meatless chili.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism."

I knew exactly what was under the tree for me.<br />As mother and father watched on warmly, my siblings and I tore through the wrappings of our gifts. Soon they'd all be jealous of me. No one was going to get something quite so special as what I was about to receive. The room was soon filled with the invigorating scent of red meat and blood.

It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com."

The second type is the  more liquidy type that you can spoon, almost pour into the cats plate.

My cat laps up all the sauce then moves on to the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Second flavor is sesame chicken: This smells really good and the chicken is not chunked but in thin strips.

If you're going to use a glass of water or small bottle of water, I'd recommend trying only half a packet (or less) to start.  There are honey granules (sugar and honey) that dissolve and sweeten the water.  The packaging touts that there's no aspartame (Equal) in these like Crystal Light, but there is sucralose listed as an ingredient, which is another artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Most importantly, though, is that these new Lipton packets, like Crystal Light packets, give your water a little boost of flavor and, in the case of green tea, flavonoids.  If you're trying to eliminate sodas from your diet and are tired of drinking ""just"" water, try these little packets.  You'll still be drinking the water, but you'll have a flavor boost that won't make you feel like you're drinking ""just"" water."

Thanksgiving at my grandmother's house, not for the cranberry sauce (which I loathe), but for the cranberry juice she always had on hand. I loved it! And she'd mix it with a bit of ginger ale for me and oh, I felt so grown up...my first cocktail! Virgin, of course. We lost her the year I started college, so every time I taste anything with cranberry, I think of her. Then growing up, my mom taught me how to make this delicious cranberry-orange bread with fresh cranberries, and that bread is why I always have cranberries in my freezer. I made it for my in-laws the first Christmas after the wedding and now they look forward to it every year. Maybe after I've tried this straight I'll need to try it with some orange juice. But cranberry is a flavor very near and dear to my heart, so I am very much looking forward to trying this one. The health benefits of cranberries aren't such a bad thing either, and since I don't drink juice anymore, this might be a good way for me to get them.<br /><br />This blew my socks off. The scent when the package is opened is a sweet cranberry, not the tart berry I was looking for, but I can't bring myself to complain. I put about a quarter of a teaspoon in a small mug, added about 75-80 C water, some sugar, and frothed it up. Then I added robots (by which I mean ice in the shape of robots) and a touch of cold water to make a beautiful iced tea. I am so far from disappointed it hurts. This is lovely. I didn't expect to like this one nearly as much as I do, but I am in love. I'm definitely seeing the berry in cranberry, but there's also a hint of tartness in the middle of the sip. I am so surprised, I honestly didn't expect to be wowed by this. But I am and I am going to restock on it ASAP. I can't wait to try it blended with some vanilla matcha or some orange juice...yum. I don't have a lot of experience with cranberry outside of the little fruits baked into muffins, but I think I need to branch out and try some new things!"

As for the Benecol itself, the butter version isn't cheap and is hard to find, so we prefer these ""caramel""-like chews.  We also use Smart Balance's Heart Smart butter spread, which uses stanols/sterols, but stores locally have discontinued it, so it has to be special-ordered at exhorbitant prices, and in a hard-to-store 6-pack.<br /><br />The wife's Drs. have had her all over the map with prescription cholesterol drugs for 20+ years, but only since she consistently uses the Benecol chews, Heart Smart spread, and RX Zetia, has her numbers become acceptable.  In the past she's used Benecol in a pill form, but I think they quit making it, and it wasn't cheap.  Neither are the chews, but Amazon's price, though variable, the ease of storage and use and tastiness, and the lab test results all make this a highly viable solution to the cholesterol problem.<br /><br />Over the years, whenever she's used some version of Benecol, her cholesterol numbers dipped.  Having Amazon automatically ship a box every 2-3 months means she for once is consistently using the stuff, and her latest lab tests bare the great results - down to 199 from over 300.  And she's been off the Crestor/Lipitor prescription scheme (except Zetia) for 6 months because they make her muscles ache.  As I understand it, Zetia works in the gut like Benecol and Heart Smart, not in the liver like Crestor, etc., so it has had no side effect we've noticed;  but I'm not sure she even needs the Zetia except to placate the Drs.<br /><br />It won't restrict your body from manufacturing its own cholesterol like Lipitor or Crestor work, but it definitely will affect your lab results by taking food-sourced cholesterol out of the picture so you won't absorb it out of your intestine.  The wife prefers the Benecol because it works and is like eating a piece of candy, rather than taking another pill.  I let her have her indulgence, and for my own cholesterol control I watch my diet, use Heart Smart spread instead of butter, and rather inconsistently use Cholest-Off caplets;  but my cholesterol count has always been on the high side of normal without pills anyway."

My son was first started on Similac Advance at the hospital, and tolerated it well until week 2 when he became so constipated we had to give him a suppository per his pediatrician.  We tried Enfamil Gentlease, and he seemed to hate it right from the start, then after remembering my cousin rave about this formula with her daughter, we tried the Good start.  I wish I had started him off with this from the beginning.  He immediately drank it down, unlike the Gentlease which he wouldn't even take more then a few sucks of.  He tolerated it so well, and the constipation was gone.  He was still gassy a bit, as all babies seem to be, but nothing excessive like before.  For a few weeks he was still a bit fussy when having a bowel movement, but again, it was such a drastic improvement from where we had been prior.  As time went by his stools became easier to pass, and now there is no fussing at all.  The preparation is easy.  You simply add the powder to water and shake.  There had been different directions on some older cans with boiling water then adding the powder, but that has since been replaced with the simple, add powder to water and shke version.  THere are far fewer bubbles after shaking then the other formula's I have tried (Similac, Enfamil) and the clumping is minimal.  Simply take a spoon etc.. to break up clumps.  The smell is tolerable too, and is much better then the other formula's I have smelled.  The price is good as well.  Babies r us seems to have the cheapest price at around $20 a can, but other stores like Kmart, Target etc... seem to come in around $23 a can and drug stores (not recommended) come in highest at $25-26 a can.  I have actually found grocery stores to be cheaper then independent drug stores for the formula, but by the far babies r us has the cheapest price."

Bad Pu-erh tastes like tea left to rot.  This definitely does not.  It has a warm oak flavor.<br /><br />Pu-erhs are ""double-fermented"".  Tea makers let the tea oxidize like black tea, and then form the leaves into cakes.  Pu-erhs take awhile to ferment; they actually have vintages like wine and can be as old as 40 or 50 years.  Because of the longer processing time, pu-erhs are generally more expensive, so this isn't a bad price for pu-erh, although it is a little pricey for tea.<br /><br />This is good pu-erh for other reasons:  unless you have a tea diffuser, you can't make pu-erh teas--they're not generally sold in bags.  If you're not really into buying a lot of tea accoutrement, e.g., an American, these bags are a real find.<br /><br />Each one will more than handily make 3 or 4 cups of tea when steeped in a several cup teapot--or you can steep repeatedly for a different taste with each cup."

After making my homemade versions of mac and cheese-less sauces and coming up with mediocre results and spending more time in the kitchen than I wanted to spend, this product is a dream come true.  My son is 11 and once he latches onto something he likes it's hard to convince him to change to something else.  At his age health reasons are no motivation to avoid dairy.  We're both lactose intolerant but can 'get away with' some dairy.  I'm vegan, but he'll still eat some dairy cheese pizza and mac and cheese on ocassion.  I continually try to come up with alturnatives, but when the cheese versons are so quick and easy and frankly taste better, it's a constant battle.  Until we found this product.  He claims it's as good if not better than the cheese versions (Amy's or Trader Joe's) and actually likes that it's creamier and more filling than those cheese-based brands.  I don't know how the reviewers (with fewer stars) prepaired theirs, but we used Almond Breeze unsweetened milk and put a little more than the recommended amount of 1/2 cup, maybe 3/4 cup, and it made it smoother and less sticky.  Using a wire wisk might help too, to mix the sauce before adding the pasta.  Then we added alttle sea salt and pepper and some Vegan Grated Topping by Galaxy Nutritional Foods.  Yum.  My son can prepare it himself and I can feel good about the ingredients.<br />I'm happily ordering a new case of 12 boxes...  Oh, and they're also extremely lightweight and convenient to toss in your bag and take along with you when you travel to visit non-veg family."

No nugets going on here, chocolate bits, caramel, icing, or peanuts either.  Just a tasty chocolate cookie shell with a delicious vanilla filling.  Keeping it simple has been the best policy for Oreo lovers for decades now. These little packages contain Oreos that are a smidgen' smaller than the regular box or bag sized variety.  What the cookie and candy industry refers to as the fun size.  That might explain some of the negative comments as to these Oreos being rather cheap with the filling.  In my opinion the ratio is the same, they are just smaller.<br /><br />This 12 pack is an excellent buy on Amazon.  Buy two of them and you get free shipping and for the majority of us, no sales tax.  A fine buy if you have a lots of Oreo fiends in your home that prefer a measured amount of these great cookies.

IT IS N O T FOR THE LACTOSE-INTOLERANT, OF COURSE -- AND TOO MUCH CAN MAKE ONE FAT AND VERY THIRSTY!!!!!<br /><br />Velveeta Loaf Mexican Mild, 16-Ounce Loaves, (Pack of 6), arrived<br />soon after I had ordered it, in perfect condition!<br /><br />The taste is a bit spicier than regular Velveeta, but that is to<br />be expected, from the name of the item.  The extra spiciness is<br />perfect for making Mexican-style sandwiches, and spicing up any<br />recipe that calls for cheese.  As with regular Velveeta, there<br />are recipes printed inside the box -- three of them beneath the<br />box that I have first opened.<br /><br />Since this cheese, (a perishable item), and other cheeses, (also<br />perishable items), are happily available on Amazon, I would like<br />to suggest that the simple METHOD of preservation used in pack-<br />ing Velveeta cheese be used, whenever possible, to preserve<br />OTHER perishable items, (like more FROZEN FOOD, and perhaps even<br />the legendary, (but, presently on Amazon, HORRENDOUSLY expens-<br />ive) TUSCAN MILK!  (The great expense is now charged by 3rd<br />0arty sellers...not Amazon.  But if the Velveeta Cheese method<br />is used,  in the near future, maybe both these 3rd-party sellers,<br />and amazon itself, could sell this legendary milk at a lower<br />price?)  The method is simply............wrapping the Velveeta<br />cheese in ALUMINUM FOIL, SHINY SIDE OUT.  The non-shiny side of<br />the aluminum foil is presumably very slightly coated, (?), thus<br />not allowing full aluminum to touch the cheese -- as well as<br />allowing the aluminum on the outside to act as preservative.<br />Another way to prserve other perishables, (including THE legend-<br />ary Tuscan Milk!), would be to FREEZE all these perishables<br />until JUST before shipment!  I know, I know -- Velveeta Mexican<br />cheese uses Sorbic Acid as a prservative, (list of all ingredi-<br />ents given below) -- but milk, I have read, can be prserved.<br />not only by freezing, but by the addition of A FEW GRAINS OF<br />EXTRA SALT!  Just think of ALL the delicious frozen food, usu-<br />ally sold only in groceries, that could be sold here on Amazon<br />with just a few extra freezers in the basement of Amazon Head-<br />quarters, and a few grains of extra salt added into those<br />products for which it is convenient to so do!<br /><br />In the meantime, I'm going to use my Velveeta Loaf, Mexican<br />Mild to try to make home-made pizzas, and other creative, spicy<br />dishes!<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:  Milk, Whey, Whey Protein Concentrate, Milkfat,<br />Milk Protein Concientrate, Sodium Phosphate, Salt, Jalapeno<br />Peppers, Vinegar, Sorbic Acid as a preservative, Sodium Algin-<br />ate, Apocarotenol, (colour), Enzymes, Cheese Culture<br /><br />NOT the healthiest thing to eat, I know.  But it sure is<br />healthier than candy!  My mom has told me that, since I have<br />been a cheese-lover all my life, she gave me cheese as a child,<br />instead of candy, as it is obviously healthier than most, if<br />not all candies!  I think this is an excellent idea, if given<br />to children in moderation!  And cheese from Velveeta Mexican<br />Loaf is extra spicy and delicious!"

I just mix a tablespoon of these and some ground flax in a little water every morning and drink it.  Not a very pleasant experience.  Not much taste, but the slurry feels terrible.  They get stuck between your teeth no matter how I try to swallow without chewing.  Chia seeds want to stick to everything once you wet them.  Cleaning glasses, bowls, etc after using them takes extra work.  I have not soaked them overnight and added to smoothies or anything, so maybe that minimizes the mess a bit.<br /><br />Having said all that, I will use them as a thickening agent in soups.  Smart people out there can probably use them countless ways.  I swallow them for their protein content and to promote a healthy digestive tract.  I definitely like the fact that they are organic.

I have hiatus hernia with the accompanying fiery esophagus and chest pain.  My medication (Omeprazole) dose is at its highest limit and was not doing the job.  I tried another medication (Protonix) and it had horrific side effects for me.<br /><br />I sought help from hiatus hernia sufferers online, and there were two kinds of suggestions for soothing the acid in the digestive system.  One was vinegar and water (too harsh) and one was baking soda and water.<br /><br />Since I was concerned about the sodium in regular baking soda, I sought medical advice.  Information about the availability of your product was given to me.  Hooray!  It is working.  1/2 teaspoon of Ener-G Improved Baking Soda Substitute, Sodium Free in water -- 3 times a day -- has eliminated the fire in my esophagus and the pains in my chest.  No discernable taste and smooth, practically non-discernable texture.  I add a tiny squirt of MIO (Liquid Water Enhancer).  Although I'm hoping to eventually wean myself off of the Omeprazole, I am sure that the Ener-G Improved Baking Soda Substitute will be always be available in my cabinet.<br /><br />I was telling my son yesterday that I'm going to give him some to try for his acid indigestion (especially at night).

Got to reading about the products.  Sodastream seems to be so proud that they did not include aspartame in their diet products, and used only sugar in their non-diet products (Instead of high fructose corn syrup).  However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.  My Sodastream is going back to the company with a message stating that if I wanted diet pop I would buy it myself, and they should only put sugar in regular soda.  They brag about real sugar, and then hide artifical sweetner in every product hoping no one will notice.  It shows in the bad taste of their regular sodas, and, in my opinion, does not make them a very reputable company.  Buyer beware."

While all mustards have a characteristic ""heat"" to them, many mustards rely solely on that heat to get them by.  This mustard has a robust flavor, reflecting a combination of flavorful mustard seeds with a flavorful wine base.  In essence, mustard, any mustard, is a combination of ground mustard seed and vinegar.  Other spices may be added, and different vinegars may be used, but this mustard from Fallot has what I consider to be the optimal combination of the two main ingredients with no other non-mustard flavors to detract from the primary flavor profile, namely Dijon mustard.  This mustard leans more towards the mild side of the heat spectrum, so those seeking a mustard burn on the palate will be disappointed.  I have also sampled some of the other fallot mustards with the various additives (i.e. basil, raspberry, honey, etc.) and they are all nice, too, if a bit limited in their usefulness (raspberry Dijon only works with so many dishes).  However, this mustard, the plain, original Fallot Dijon, can blend seamlessly into the background of so many dishes.  For those of you who seek a proof of these claims, just put this mustard to the simplest and most telling moutarde test there is: vinaigrette.  mix a spoonful of this Fallot Dijon with a few teaspoons of wine vinegar, some salt, pepper, and herbs (fresh thyme is always reliable), and about a 1/2 cup of olive oil and you will understand the sublime versatility of this excellent Dijon mustard!"

I even took a frozen one with me when I went out in the morning on errands and by the time I needed it, it was defrosted and ready to eat.  It has kind of a dense texture that goes better with a coffee or tea, but is fine by itself too.  I usually used them for an on-the-go thing, but especially delicious was warming it up in the toaster oven.  It really felt more like a desserty treat then.  I think the calorie count might be kind of high on this, but for me the ingredients and purpose outweighed that con.  The best thing about this item by far, was the fact that it FILLED ME UP.

This vanilla flavor is pretty good, however, though I will say that I don't like it enough to buy it again.  The real winner of the three is the caramel flavor.  While drinking it won't make you think you're eating a caramel candy, it does have a very pleasing flavor whether consumed hot or cold.  That's the only flavor of the three that I have purchased repeatedly and will purchase again.<br /><br />As for the underlying coffee flavor of this particular flavor, I think it suffices to say that it tastes like a medium roasted Starbucks coffee.

The calories are okay, 135 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  You wouldn't want to drink a lot of it every day, but 135 calories is fine for once or twice a day.  The fizz is light, similar to Fanta, which is something I really like about this product.  The only thing I don't like is the taste that the vitamin c adds.  The extra vitamin c gives it an aftertaste similar to red bull and other energy drinks.  I think this product would taste a lot better without it, and I don't see any real value in having it.  Vitamin C is one of the easiest vitamins to get.  There aren't a lot of people in the modern world running around with scurvy.<br /><br />The other concern is price.  This stuff is very expensive, almost $1 per 8.3 oz can.  The idea here is suppose to be that this is a soda replacement.  At that price, I don't think so.  A 12 pack of soda (with 12 oz cans) typially runs from $3 - $5.  The Switch costs more than double that.  If this product wants to compete with the soda market they really need to bring the price down.<br /><br />If you like this, just get some low sodium Pellegrino and some concentrated juices.  You can mix your own for a lot less and not have the vitamin c aftertaste."

I guess thats the benefit of buying in bulk.<br /><br />But then, the package arrived this morning.  In the package is two 8 serving packs.  Now, it is important to note that with any Tassimo Lattes, there are two T-Disks needed for each serving.  1 is the milk and the other is the espresso or tea.  So there are 16 T-Disks in each package but only 8 servings.  Everywhere else on the planet, it will cost you between $1.00 and $1.37 per serving.  Here, it will cost you twice that much.

I opened the first one and was appalled by the smell. I managed to choke down three bites and the only good thing I can say about this stuff is that it didn't make me sick immediately. I threw the rest away. Later I went back in the kitchen and thought I smelled where my little dog had an accident but it was only the open package reeking from the trash.  I have eaten homemade  ostrich jerky but this tastes nothing like it. It is hard to believe it is ostrich. Do not buy this product. Even my cats and dog couldn't eat it.

I have the 29oz and have looked all over the web (including the Nutiva site) to see if they mention what plastic this container is.  Nowhere is it to be found.  There are a handful of mentions of no. 1 plastic (when it was in a clear jar).  But nothing about these white plastic jars that now seem to be the norm for most sizes.  So when I got home today I turned mine over and found a ""2"".  HDPE.  Don't have to worry about BPA but I don't know much about HDPE.<br /><br />If they carried this in a glass jar I would be happier though I would need to find at local brick and mortar stores because I am sure shipping would be a lot. Like others on account of the container, I give it a 4 star rating.<br /><br />This is the BEST EVCO I have had to date and I will continue to use it.  As for transferring it to another container: I have many Ball jars because I use a foodsaver vacuum sealer to keep things.  However, the lining of the jar lids is apparently BPA rich.  So, I will keep it in the white plastic number 2 and hope for the best.<br /><br />Again, this is a great quality EVCO and I haven't heard a single bad word about it except for the plastic jar so wanted to add what information I could for those making a decision."

Packaged like regulard Graham crackers, they taste very similar as well. Though, there's a slight after taste that goes away after eating a few. The ingredients are simple enough: graham flour (whole grain wheat flour), whole grain rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, safflower oil, honey, raisin paste, brown rice syrup, leavening (baking soda and monocalcium phosphate), sea salt, cinnamon, and Vitamin E to help protect flavor. There are no artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors. So, the crackers do taste slightly different from the name brand graham crackers, but lacking the unhealthy preservatives. There are 110 calories per serving, and serving size is 2 full cracker sheets. The picture on the box does not do the cracker justice, making the crackers look bland and dry. Just as the name brand, these crackers are sweet enough to be called cookies and satisfy my sweet tooth. Yet, they're a healthy snack choice.

By itself Red Espresso drink is too strong and too demanding.

I have been using their dressings for several years.  Not all of their dressings are as good, in my opinion, as the Thousand Island but all will help control blood sugars.  What I like about the Thousand Island particularly is the creamy texture of the dressing and the taste.  You can use it on salads, burger melts or in a low carb rueben wrap. (I use the Santa Fe Tortilla 6 carb wrap)<br /><br />People who complain that Walden Farms products don't taste the same as 'normal' dressings have a valid point and it shows how much we have come to equate 'good taste' with sugar.  One way to check out your favorite dressing or catsup is to look at the ingredients and see how high sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn sugar, is on the list. It is no surprise that sugar is often up there near the top and often listed multiple times. Some dressings produced by major brands, however, have only two carbs per serving.  For many people, myself included, this is a tossup.  In some cases taste and cost may swing toward buying the major brand.  For more selections check at the Walden Farms website and don't forget to check at your local grocery or health food store to compare prices on this brand.<br /><br />Clearly, if you are looking to control your families intake of carbs, the Walden Farms brand is a good choice.  If you know of other brands with zero carbs that taste as good or better please add your comments to this review.  There is nothing I like better than hearing about something that tastes great with zero or low carbs.  Your comments may assist myself and others who are living with diabetes and want to live a better and longer life."

In Japan, where the dish is called m'b' t'fu, it was introduced by Chen Kenmin who opened the first Sichuanese restaurant in Tokyo in the 1950s. Instead of using only the salty and spicy bean paste, Chen also adopted sweet bean paste in the recipe and make the dish less spicy and less oily.""<br /><br />Having eaten this dish served in a Chinese restaurant, I agree House Foods Chinese Mabo Tofu Sauce is less oily than the authentic recipe.

Add the sauce and simmer. Gently stir in cubed tofu and simmer again.<br /><br />My suggestions:<br /><br />+ Press and drain your tofu before adding it to the sauce.

It only takes a minute and 15 seconds to heat up, so it is a quick and convenient meal. The container is compact enough that you can keep several cans in your desk so you can just grab one when you're ready for lunch. Being able to heat up the container means one less bowl to clean and it's easy enough to rinse out and recycle the can when you are through with it.

Yes, I love its convenience, but it's too tall. The soup is meant to be sipped, not eaten with a spoon, but you still have to stir it and when you use a spoon to do it, almost the entire spoon goes into the can, which is very messy. Also, the plastic lid on the can is hard to take off and the opening to sip the soup needs to be wider, since items like the potatoes and clams sometimes get stuck and you need to take the lid off to finish the soup - and it's very hard to use a spoon to eat the remainder because of the shape of the can.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts: Each container has one service size that is 160 calories (calories from fat are 90).

His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY"">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats."

I'm no salami expert, but I have been eating food my whole life, and this tastes really good in my opinion. The texture isn't grainy like some of the more gourmet brands I've wasted my hard earned dollar on. Surprisingly it isn't very greasy, no gristle bits, no bitter aftertaste, and it smells good for a salami. Their use of salt and spices are well balanced. You could eat this with a sweet beverage and there is no conflicting flavors. Overall I rate this 5 stars and will be ordering this from Amazon again."

Scherner,0,1,1,1348185600,"If Your Kids are Stupid Enough to Think Water is Cool When It's In a Bottle with a Cartoon Character, Then Fork Over Your Cash","Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach ""is green and sticks in your teeth"" in comparison to the water that ""comes in a cool bottle."" Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual ""special"" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids ""buying power"" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach."

I've been trying to find a cereal with a lot of fiber that tastes good. I find most don't taste very good. According to WebMD, most Americans only get 14g of fiber. I usually have two servings of this cereal for breakfast, so I'm halfway to my allotment of daily fiber.<br /><br />My nutritionist at Carolina advised me a diet high in whole grains and fiber leads to less weight over the years. Maybe this cereal doesn't help you lose weight, but it certainly doesn't put it on. These aren't empty calories, this cereal is filling and nutritious."

These are incredible!  The almonds, pistachios, pepitas (pumpkin seeds), and cashews are roasted in a way that makes them almost crispy.  They are bound together into little bites with a fragile coating of delicious toffee, and then dipped into dark chocolate.  I wish I could describe how they almost shatter in your mouth with a very pleading crunch.  The combination of the different nuts, toffee, and dark chocolate was much better than I expected too.  These were just too delicious!  The four of us ate the whole large bag in one sitting.  They were that good!  They aren't inexpensive though, so save them for holidays or special events.

I think it is probably the  best natural drink that I have found to promote hydration.<br /><br />I love the natural, the passion fruit and the mango flavors.  All of them taste natural because they are..they are not sweet and the fruit flavors are really only the essence of the flavor itself and are quite subtle tasting.<br /><br />I can't think of a better or more healthy drink...in fact because of its potassium content, I consider it a better drink than plain water.

It's a lot of paper and plastic for 9 pieces of gum, so I dropped it a star for that.<br /><br />The gum is nicely flavored.  I do like the texture aspect when biting into a crunchy outer coating, and getting into the soft center.  The flavor lasts a long, long time.

Even the small cardboard tab with the string had an oily residue on it. Good Earth says it was made in China per the numbers on the box. I reported to the store where I purchased. They are talking with the corporate office. Good Earth will be getting one of the two boxes I have for testing. I will not use this product again. I have been using this tea for approximately 10 years. About a year ago, they changed to the ""new look"" box. I could no longer get 1.5 cups of tea per tea bag. It was barely enough for one cup.

My concern is what is in this product?  What types of chemicals or pesticides were sprayed on the herbs?  How pure is the oil?  The product does not have an herbal scent but rather a chemical smell.  What is in this?  I worry because the scalp absorbs products readily and these things end up in your bloodstream....that includes any hair dye and shampoos you use.  The ingredients are especially important here because we are supposed to leave this on overnight  thus giving the scalp a lot of exposure to some unknown ingredients.  Keep in mind that the chemicals and pesticides that were banned in the US years ago are shipped to third world nations and frequently re-imported into this country via these types of products.  I don't know what is in this and it may be great but I am concerned about the smell...it is not a natural scent."

It did not have the fish smell after rinsing, nor while eating it. The texture is comparable to the rice noodles you find in Vietnamese and Japanese dishes. I am a convert to miracle noodle. I fed two people off of one pack, not bad i say. Also noticed the difference in the curving of my snack urges(didn't even touch my yogurt, orange, or nature valley peanut butter bar until near the end of my shift at work), and could wait longer before i took my lunch at work.

And unlike cornmeal, it doesn't burn when used on a hot baking stone.

When I compare the flavor of the Sleepytime Vanilla to the regular Sleepytime I must say that the regular Sleepytime is much more complex. I think I may need to use four teabags per mug of tea since two teabags do not make a strong enough tea. I'd almost suggest that you just add some vanilla to regular Sleepytime tea for a fuller flavor. Celestial Seasonings should rethink this tea and make it stronger.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S. I tried four teabags and the flavor still wasn't that great. This just doesn't have the same taste as Sleepytime. I think they should go back to the original blend and then add extra vanilla. It seems they have taken out some of the main ingredients to make room for vanilla.<br /><br />P.S. II - I tried six teabags and that seemed to be the best so far. I needed to steep the tea for at least twenty minutes.

But you know what ... it is still summer and I am going to totally enjoy drinking this and many other light matchas to come!<br />As I am sitting here in delight sipping away I am noticing this almost earthy flavor to it - no not the normal earthy grassy flavor of a matcha or green tea, but something else. The prominent flavors are still the same, tart, juicy, etc, not to be redundant, but there is something more, its one of those flavors you swish around in your mouth, tap tap tap your tongue around, make those smacking sounds trying so hard to pin point it but it is eluding me! I want someone else to get some of this so they can help me figure it out.<br />Yes this one is a delight and to think I almost passed it up I mean I was not too sure what to expect and didn't want something too overly tart but thank goodness I went for it!"

Unfortunately, my fears were confirmed when I actually tasted the coffee -- first black and then with sweetener and milk.  The bitter, burnt taste was very pronounced and this was at less than half the recommended brew strength, i.e., 3 level tablespoons for 8 cups.

To be honest I think it tastes curiously like mouthwash. I can't really get past that and enjoy it. It's almost like mint tea that has waaaaay too much sugar in it or something. I am a HUGE fan of Synergy/GT's Kombucha, but I thought I'd try this because it's slightly cheaper. I have to say that the Synergy is well worth the extra $12 per 12 bottle case (I purchase the cases at Whole Foods for $35).<br /><br />Even if I could get past the minty mouthwash taste, I still have to question the health benefits of this brand of Kombucha given the ingredients list. It reads: Lightly carbonated water, sucrose, herbal tea blend, Kombucha cultures, lactobacilli, acerola juice concentrate. You don't even get to kombucha until the fourth ingredient - and that comes after water and sugar?? One can drink seltzer water with sugar and ""herbal tea"" for much cheaper than $23/12 bottles. Seriously. Spend the extra few bucks and buy the Synergy, whose ingredients are as follows (this is for the ""Trilogy"" flavor): 95% GT's organic raw kombucha, raspberry juice, lemon juice, fresh pressed ginger juice, and 100% pure love.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want mint soda, then by all means, seize the day.

My son has a dairy intolerance and I had to stop breastfeeding when he was 4.5 months old.  This product was a lifesaver!!  He drinks it happily, and his symptoms, since switching to Alimentum, have subsided (knock on wood).<br /><br />That said, beware of ordering through Amazon. I ordered several cases for my baby through Amazon Prime almost one month ago & have received multiple emails telling me that the product is unavailable for shipment. Meanwhile, several vendors list the product as available on Amazon (including Amazon's subsidiary, Diapers.com). I've contacted customer service several times, but have continued to get the runaround.  I suspect that this has to do with an attempt to avoid honoring the lower list price (the Amazon prices drastically increased recently).  It's a sad sad day when Amazon disappoints.  Notably, when I've ordered the full price product through Diapers.com, it's arrived the next day.<br /><br />In any event, the formula itself has been great!"

207009,B002ANA68G,A3NTV9VHMBY1KH,"Kimberly A. Kubek ""Doodle lover""",9,9,4,1175731200,Very good ingredient list with extras.,"I have a Goldendoodle and felt he was a little on the thin side, so I started researching dog foods. I found that what he was on, was not really good for him. The second ingredient was ground corn and I found out that shouldn't be in the dog food at all. It's all filler, non-digestible...filler in, filler out. Through this surfing and sifting of information, what was good, explanation of terms, and eager for any information I could get and then pursue, I ended with Canidae All Life Stages Dry. There were others under consideration, but considering cost, balanced with good nutrition, supplements included in the food, and availability, I opted for Canidae.<br /><br />Of the top five ingredients, before the fat (in this case chicken fat), three are animal protein meal, Chicken, Turkey and Lamb meals. The other two ingredients are Brown and White rice, good easily digestible grains. My understanding is dog food is weighted and the ingredients listed based on that weight prior to them being reduced in the cooking process. Meaning when your ingredient list - lists chicken first, that is precooked weight. After cooking the water and some of the nutrients and calories are lost in the process and if the same ingredients were measured for listing after cooking, the ingredient list would not come out looking as good. Chicken might not be as high in the list. If a 'chicken meal' is listed, they start with the same grade of chicken, generally speaking, however meal is weighted and listed after it has been cooked down. This is the same for any 'meal' protein. A 'meal' protein is just the protein you end up with after it is cooked down, the water cooked out of it. So a 'meal' protein in the ingredient list is a good grade meat protein, which won't be reduced by the processing of the ingredients together. Five lbs. of chicken, may end up to be 4lbs, however 5lbs of 'chicken meal', stays 5lbs.(this is made up example for clarity, not based on any math or science). The ingredients go on to list additional herring meal, vitamins, probiotics (for good intestinal health), natural preservatives and supplements like amino acids and calcium to name a couple.<br /><br />Beforehand, Riley was less than excited about meal time. He would pick at it almost from the beginning, walk away, come back - a little more eating and allot of drinking. Now, he eats it.<br /><br />A big benefit and another part of the reason for a search, is the reduction in feces. He was going 6 or 7 times a day and no small amount. We are down to two - four times/day so far. Improvement in condition of feces also. Firmer, more normal coloring, less of it. It seems like his body is getting more out of his food.<br /><br />He seems to have an improved activity level. His playfulness is increased, but not hyper by any means. Just healthier? perhaps. Calms right down on command, even around the other dogs.<br /><br />So far so good for this change. I have read that poor results can happen after weeks or months of a change, but so far so good. He doesn't shed, so I'm watching carefully for any new hair loss. I won't wait it if occurs, I will take him off. I certainly would say, conditionally, this is turning out to be a good food for my dog and would suggest it to others looking for a quality food.<br /><br />** It's been about 2 months now on Canidae.  Riley is still looking good.  No sudden hair loss, healthy, energetic, eating as I type...Still happy with this decision, and am still using it."

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next."

Got a new shipment in and I noticed a color change on the K-cup, orange to light green. Uh-oh, wrong product? I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you're a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference. Time for a new favorite with a company that doesn't play sleazy tricks on its loyal customers.

I took a risk when I found this Zevia on Amazon.com, especially since you had to put out almost $30 for a 24-pack.  My initial order was for the Black Cherry and the Caffeine Free.  Thankfully, they were great tasting and well worth the expense.  Without hesitation, I returned to Amazon.com to try the Grapefruit Citrus, as I have been a fan of Fresca for years but not the aspartame they use.  Sadly, this did not measure up to expectations, not even close.  The taste and odor are pungent (almost ""bodily fluid""-pungent) and I could not finish even one can.  I will probably reorder the caffeine free but, unfortuntely,  will not be able to return this cola because of Amazon's return policy on grocery items.  I don't begrudge the policy, just the loss.  In fact, it is this loss which inspired me to write this review because I (and I'm sure I'm not alone) base a good amount of my purchases on the online reviews of a product.

However, I love it!  I eat a lot Asian food so I was able to accept the initial smell and unique texture.  The ""fishy"" smell rises out.  It wasn't strong smelling when i opened it up, but because I read the past reviews I had to give it a good sniff to see what they were complaining about.  And yes, it was not a very appetizing smell, but it went away after rising it for about 30 seconds.  I ate my first serving of Miracle Noodle with a Japanese noodle soup base (used for tempura sauce, somen, udon, etc.) and it worked perfectly.  I was positively giddy.  Zero calories!  I actually love the texture.  It's a little rubbery but not chewy.  I don't know what it can be compared to in our common American cuisine, but it is made from a vegetable, so expect a more vegetable-like texture. Like another reviewer stated, it is similar to Asian glass noodles.<br /><br />Now for the big test: Let my husband try it.<br />New foods often ignite dialogue like,<br />""Eww, I hate X.""<br />""You've never tried X.""<br />""Yeah cuz I don't like it.""<br />LOL. He has, however, become more adventurous with new foods and seeing me dance around singing ""zero calories"" tempted him enough. I gave him a bite and he just kind of responded with ""meh"".  I didn't expect much, so I count that as a success in my book! With the right ingredients and maybe some hot sauce, I'm sure he'd like it just fine.<br /><br />I am excited to try different methods of preparing this noodle.  It seems like the perfect filler food in place of rice or pasta.  MUCH healthier.  It really does just take on the flavor of what it's prepared with.  I was able to find individual packages a shirataki noodles (different brands) in my local Asian food market (next to produce) at a lower price, however I have not tried it yet.  It looks exactly the same and I can't imagine it'd be much different.  So if you're hesitant about buying a 6-pack, maybe you could try that first.<br /><br />I am so glad Miracle Noodle has marketed this product in this way to help get this out to more people.  I would have never thought something like this existed.  This has become one of my new staples.  Bye-bye high calorie noodles!"

Hernandez,0,0,5,1341619200,Royal fireworks indeed,"Twinings Variety Pack of Four Flavors, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) at $17.14 is a STEAL.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Twinings tea, then perhaps you ought to start tasting REAL tea - the type the Royal Family awakens to, the type everyone who enjoys tea outside the U.S. enjoys at tea time.<br /><br />Twinings, around since the beginning of the 18th century, literally saved my life. While I shall not go into that story, I will tell you what you can expect: a decent, dazzling cup of tea that will, I guarantee, make you basically drop coffee forever.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the meal known as 'tea' since I was a boy. My parents avoided it for some reason but I always had my Twinings. Since it got too complex hereabouts, I just order tea bags these days instead of a good old-fashioned brew-up with my favorite antique English teapot.<br /><br />It appears that in this variety pack you are getting the following: English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Earl Grey and Lady Grey. For you ignorant slobs, Irish breakfast is the finest, blackest and strongest tea you can get. English is a bit dialed back but it is just as hearty. These beg for cream and sugar, but it is no sin to have it black. The Greys are meant to be taken with lemon and you'll suffer if you try to pour cream or milk into either of them!<br /><br />So there you are: a world of tea in one neat box, from my ONLY tea providers and lifelong at that. You can visit their site and buy direct; you can examine <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006RXQ2CY"">The Queen</a> closely and watch for the scene that reveals the Queen Mum's preferred tea.<br /><br />My second favorite, Irish breakfast tea being my first love, is the incomparable <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MOWL8M"">Twinings English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (20 Tea Bags)</a>, blended from premium Keemun and Ceylon (just you try to get good Keemun at a reasonable price).<br /><br />In the event it interests you, Twinings tea bags are designed like Lipton's clever invention, the 'double' tea bag (what they originally named ""FLOW-THROUGH"") that you can puff apart a bit if you like before steeping it. Twinings does not have any staples anywhere on their teabags, unlike other companies with a staple here and a staple there. You might as well buy staple-flavored tea.<br /><br />Get Twinings good cheer, the genuine cup that cheers."

I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.

The chocolatey flavor really spices things up, and when you're brewing this stuff you can't help but try to mentally speed the process up so you can get your hands on a cup.

But the can says product of Denmark that was apparently put together in Atlanta, GA.  The good news is that the apparently international effort of creating a can of this beverage is actually worthwhile!<br /><br />This one is really good...hit the spot perfectly.

Amazon's price is like $6 more than going into Target and buying it. Although Amazon has a great deal on Ghiradelli's Dark Caramel. Maybe the Truffle will come on sale. Enjoy!!"

I admit I'm a bit of a coffee snob and come from a long line of coffee snobs. My Dad roasts his own beans and when you've had fresh roasted? From a high end brewing system? Heaven. We have the latest model and for Senseo coffee having tried everything out there, honestly this flavor is very good. But that's with the qualification of it's Senseo coffee most of which kinda is on par with crappy diner coffee or instant. This is about the quality of Starbucks. Mass produced and flavored, but drinkable. I bought this because we have relatives in town visiting our baby and honestly, they just want a cup of joe when they crawl out of bed and don't seem to mind what it tastes like as long as it's fresh. I don't have the time or patience with an infant to wait on them so this was an easy solution that each person visiting can do themselves when they wake up at various times throughout the morning without risking anyone messing up the fabulous coffeemaker my family gave me over Christmas (these relatives have broken two similar machines in the past....sigh!). I do like the greener pod factor over the plastic k-cups and with going through so much of these, I'd feel terrible filling my recycle bin instead of our compost pile. So an easy fix and a win-win. If you love the Senseo coffee, this is worth it."

I wowed two different groups of guests with risottos that sprang from this rice.  I was very pleased with the results.<br /><br />It's very reasonably priced also.  It can be had for 31% of the price of one of it's Carnaroli rivals.  Amazon will give you four kilos for almost the same price as 1 kilo of the Carnaroli.  Does Carnaroli yield better results?

My thought with these sticks was that if I cut a little off one end, it would be a perfect fit for the everlasting ball.  It turns out, they are hard as a rock!  I tried a couple of different knives and even my meat cleaver, but none of them made any headway in cutting off the 2"" I needed to remove.  Then I picked it up and tried to break it with my hands, and it snapped in two right on the line I had been trying to cut (perhaps I scored it a little).  Anyway, it turns out that is the secret to these things - breaking instead of cutting.<br /><br />I am not in the least concerned about the caloric value of them so that was not figured into my perception of the treats in any way.  One of my dogs is slender - the other downright skinny (has a high metabolism and is offered plenty to eat but never finishes a meal).  The older, slender dog got the 2"" bit I cut off and the younger skinny dog got the remainder of the stick in her everlasting ball.  May not be fair but she had to work harder to get it so it all comes out in the wash.<br /><br />The older dog practically took my hand off to get to the treat quickly.  Once she had it, she ran off and put it back on the floor so she could take her time with it.  I will say that the little 2"" stick lasted her much longer than I would have expected so I rate them high for that reason.  The chewing action is good for their teeth/jaws and is far preferable to a treat they gobble down without tasting.<br /><br />The younger dog went racing after her everlasting ball and stayed busy for a long time trying to get it out.  I wasn't around when she finally succeeded to know how long it took her to eat it but am glad it kept her interested for awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is cute and the bag is resealable.  I believe they are kind of pricey and for that reason I might not order them again.  Otherwise I am completely satisfied."

I'm always so nervous and anxious and chamomille tea is not as great tasting and calming to me as rooibos tea.  The great thing about this tea is that you can benefit from this wonderful medicinal herb without it tasting like the usual flowery herbs (like licorice, flowery herbs/roots/leaves, mint, hibiscus, rosehips, etc.) which is what i hate about Celestial Seasonings Tea and why i moved away from Twinings blackcurrant tea when they changed the formula.  I used to drink Twinings blackcurrant tea regularly until they changed the formula to something bitter & stronger with the strange yucky tasting floral herbal components.  Then I switched to rooibos tea because of the health/taste benefits and found Twinings to be the cheapest locally.  I buy mine at my local Walgreen's for the cheapest local price, but it looks like you get a more bargain deal here on Amazon.  It tastes like mellow nutty hay and you don't really need much sweetener to sweeten it up.  Double your health benefits by adding raw organic honey.  The longer you steep it, the more the herb tea will seep out its benefits.  I've heard bathing in it regularly will heal skin conditions.  The best rooibos teas (in teabag form) in the US i've tasted with attractive packaging I'd give as a gift to a friend are the artistic ""NUMI"" and hearty ""Republic of Tea"" rooibos teas but they're much more expensive."

Now, here comes the best part, the suggar apple fruit is AWESOME!!!!!, and likely it will become your favorite fruit after you eat it. So down to business, how do you grow the tree? Get a small pot with good soil (rich in nutrients), and put 4 seeds next to each other and about 3 mm or so deep in the soil. It is important that the seeds are covered by the soil but not deep into it. Next, water your pot+seeds. Important, these seeds like rain water and germinate fast with it.

Never mind that it snowed today. Anyway, the berryness of this was just right, not overly sweet or fake, just amazingly delicious.

I have the memory span of a goldfish, so it was like I given a gift of amazing tea every time I took a sip.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

Vanilla is derived from the seductively aromatic vanilla bean.<br /><br />Vanilla beans are actually the cigar-shaped seed pod from a fragrant climbing orchid native to tropical America.<br /><br />Yes, vanilla extract is much more economical, but using vanilla beans is rather gourmet.

Let sit for 15 minutes. One thing that I've seen mentioned here and it bears repeating. After it sits for 15 minutes, you are going to have to add a bit of water to the mix as it sets up too stiff. Just a tablespoon or so should get it to waffle consistency. Another thing mentioned is that your go to ladle is probably going to put too much on the waffle iron. My first waffle spilled out of the iron. (That is when I tasted the batter.) The next waffle, I was careful to put a few tablespoons less on the iron and I got a perfect waffle.<br /><br />3 cups of mix yielded two Belgian waffles.<br /><br />I am using the Waring Waffle Maker Pro.

This may be caused by the pain of gum disease or broken teeth, decreased senses of smell or taste, and kibble too hard or too big for older mouths to chew. Pedigree does a great service to our aging canine population by formulating foods that appeal to the older dog; the kibble is easier to chew and appears to have a yummy smell to the dog. My 12 year old chow girl was just not eating and seemed sad. Cham seemed to be on a physical decline. I have used other Pedigree foods for decades and decided to try this senior dog food. She began eating a little more at each meal. Her coat shine has returned and her eyes twinkle once more. She has resumed barking at passing strangers-a sound that I was actually happy to hear again.

I've not tried the salt or cocoa flavors, but the pepper and salt taste very good. Very nutty with just the right amount of black pepper bite. These snacks are derived mostly from wheat and sunflower seeds with some sesame seeds. In addition to the black pepper flavor there is a slight hint of jalapeno and even less of garlic. While these are a great alternative to peanuts, they are not a low fat or low caloric snack. Each piece, or cracker, is about 10 calories and a serving has 10% of your RDA of sodium. Indeed, they taste very salty and suspiciously are difficult to stop eating.<br /><br />If I like Somersaults so much, why just 3 stars? If you look at the ingredients it seems odd that a high sodium snack has salt as its last ingredient. In fact, modified food starch comes before salt. Where is the rest of the sodium coming from? Look closely at the ""seasonings."" In parentheses the seasonings used in the snack are listed in order of abundance. The very first ""seasoning"" is ""spices"" and the second seasoning is ""yeast extract."" Yeast extract is an analog for MSG (processed free glutamic acid). In short, the sodium is mostly coming from a form of MSG. Please be careful eating these if you are sensitive to MSG.<br /><br />So what do we have here? A tasty snack that contains too much sodium and has a flavor enhancer derived from a form of MSG. I still really really like these snacks and I will continue to buy them, but with so much sodium and the use of yeast extract I can't rate these any higher. Note that this company is not by any means alone is labeling something as ""all natural"" while using a form of MSG."

Riley,22,22,5,1282003200,A Yankee's take on a British staple,"Having lived in the US all of my life (although I have traveled quite a bit) I had never heard of Marmite until last week. I've been participating in an on-line, UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising. As we discussed products that we grew up with and are still loyal to Marmite came up several times. I looked at some Marmite ads (the British call them ""adverts""), and then searched for it on Amazon. Being a dedicated foodie I decided to give it a shot. Here is my impression:<br /><br />When I first opened the glass jar and gave it a whiff it seemed oddly familiar. I put just a dab on my spoon and tasted it straight. Again, strangely familiar. The taste was very strong, almost condensed. I could taste the beer-like yeast but I was also getting a savory, deep vegetable flavor. Then it hit me.<br /><br />I love to make sauces and I often use pre-made glaces and demi-glaces which have a very thick consistency when gently heated (before heating they are almost solid). They come in many different varieties: beef; duck; veal; chicken; lamb; seafood; mushroom; vegetable; etc. Marmite has a strong resemblance to a straight, undiluted, vegetable glace. Pungent, earthy and with that quality that the Japanese refer to as ""Umami"". WOW! Who knew? Well, I guess a lot of people did but it was new to me. Now, what to do with it...<br /><br />My on-line British friends gave me some sage advice: use it sparingly and on some sort of bread with butter. I bought some fresh English Muffin bread from a local artisan bakery shop, lightly toasted it, coated it thinly with about 2/3 teaspoon of Marmite and spread some salted Vermont cultured butter onto it. HEAVEN! The Marmite balanced out the heaviness of the butter perfectly. That gave me the inspiration for my next test. I've alway loved a toasted bagel with cream cheese or Marscapone but need something to cut the palate-coating fat of the cheese besides a slice of onion (lox works well if you have it). Marmite fit the bill technically, but I think that I will have to get used to the combination. Still, I will keep using it here for a while and I think that it might become a favorite for me.<br /><br />Next I tried it in a simple sauce. I browned a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (who am I kidding? I used 2 tablespoons of butter). After the shallots were browned I added 3 tablespoons of Marite and 1 teaspoon of water. I reduced it a little and added 1/3 cup of heavy cream, a small bouquet garnet in cheesecloth and 1 tablespoon of dry sherry. I reduced it by about half and adjusted the strength by adding more Marmite (I needed more, maybe I should have used less cream). When finished it tasted really good, not great but it could certainly WOW most people. Put this on fish, chicken, turkey, or any light meat or veggie and it works.<br /><br />Marmite has an advertising campaign that tells people that they will either love it or hate it. I am definitely in the love camp."

How hard is that?,"1 bag = 204 calories<br /><br />The easy way to find out how many calories there are in what you are eating is to know how many calories are in the entire bag, box, can, etc. since people rarely eat ""one serving"".  And the number of servings and the number of calories per servings is always included in the nutritional information on the container.  However I have noticed on Amazon that this is not the case.  When the nutritional information is shown it's ""ONE"" serving, in this case 18 grams.  How unhelpful is that?  They make it a process to find out how many calories are in this bag of mangoes, for example.  They tell you how many calories are in 18 grams; I personally think it's an attempt at deception or misleading if you want to be kind by the vendor.  In any case, there are 204 calories in one bag.  one ounce = 28.349 grams; 2.2 ounces per bag X 28.349 = 62.368 grams; 62.368 grams/18 = 3.465 servings per bag.  3.465 X 59 calories per 18 grams = 204.428 calories.  I'm going to ask Amazon to ask the vendors that when they say they are including the information on the product in the description that they provide all of it and part of this is the number of servings contained.  I believe that the vendors are required by law to provide the number of servings on the container but I'm not sure about online.  This is conveniently left out; plus, who the heck deals with servings in grams?  When is the last time you measured out a serving in grams?  Americans use ounces."

That's not your usual gravy by any stretch of the imagination -- gravy generally has a lot of fat whether it's chicken, beef or turkey. But my family is calorie-conscious and I decided to give Campbell's Chicken Fat Free Gravy a try. When it arrived from Amazon and I gave it a taste test, I was delightfully surprised at its very good flavor. I served it without announcing that it's fat free until I noticed that the family had enjoyed it and I even received compliments.<br /><br />Well, 24 cans are not staying around as long as I expected they might, so I'm ready to order another case. Opening a can with the pop-top lid, heating and putting it on the table has become a last minute thing. Buying by the case from Amazon is a terrific deal. Campbell's fat free isn't available in my area and there's only a generic available at one local supermarket costing $2.89 for a 12 oz. can. Don't think I'll bother taste testing that one.<br /><br />The calorie count is 15 per serving size (1/4 cup). That's even considered a ""free food"" on the ADA and Weight Watcher's exchange lists. The sodium count is a bit high at 13%, but I find that to be true in any prepared foods. I must admit it doesn't have that golden color you get from chicken gravy that contains fat, but I've solved that by occasionally adding a couple of drops of Kitchen Bouquet when it's meant to be ladled over potatoes, rice, etc. I don't bother when using it in recipes.

The previous reviews for this product are one extreme or the other, I think probably for 2 reasons. First, the original ""Creamy"" version in the squat jars was kind of slimy and a bit weird; the newer one is improved in texture and taste. Second, this stuff has  a sweet, 'lite' taste like Reese's PB, so customers used to natural peanut butter or even Skippy, and expecting to use it to make a PB sandwich, probably don't care for it.<br /><br />By contrast, I think this stuff is great for low-Calorie peanut buttery desserts, like spread thin on low-Cal brownies or on fat-free ricotta with a drizzle of Walden Farms Chocolate Syrup (Low-Carb) 12 oz.<br /><br />Do be aware, however, that as with all Walden Farms products, this stuff DOES contain Calories: the zero Calorie labeling relies on the FDA's rounding rules (like all those products that claim 'zero trans fats' but contain partially hydrogenated vegetable oils). Assume 3-4 Calories per labeled serving for all."

I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked ""natural""), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]"

It's sort of like the epiphany you have when you think American cheese is the best cheese you've ever had until you actually try smoked gouda. I know that sounds like an overstatement, but that's how good Herr's Heinz-flavored ketchup chips are. Once you try these, all of your previous favorites will start to pale in comparison.<br /><br />""What's so darned great about them?"" you are probably wondering. What's gotten everyone in such a tizzy? Why the rave reviews and the almost cult-like devotion to these chips? It's not just because they taste good. It's because Herr's is one of the few snack makers that bucks that shady practice so many of them engage in now, especially Pringles. You know what I mean-- that cute, little trick of advertising their chips as literally bursting with flavor, when in reality the chips are so lightly dusted that there's barely any flavor to them. Herr's philosophy in terms of chip-to-flavor ratio couldn't be more different. Open any one of their snacks-- especially this one-- and the chips are so covered in powder that it's impossible to not have it cake up on your finger tips without constantly cleaning them. These Heinz ketchup flavored chips are so heavily dusted, in fact, that you'll wind up with red-stained fingers for a few hours after gorging on them. It makes for a messy experience but in the end, getting a moutful of flavor with each bite makes the hassle of cleaning up all worthwhile!<br /><br />Sure, this excessive powder doesn't exactly make Herr's the healthiest of snack choices, but what snack is? It's all gonna kill us, anyway, so really-- all this really comes down to is choosing our poison. My poison happens to be these chips, and will most likely be yours once you taste them and subsequently become hopelessly addicted like me."

Summers,0,0,5,1254096000,Deceptive or insufficient information?,"I don't specifically disagree with the first reviewer -- but he makes some claims that I, personally, cannot find information on the box to support.  Yes, they group the ""whole grains and seeds"" as first ingredient (actually, the first set of ingredients).  Within this ""ingredient"", they include whole wheat flour, black and white sesame seeds, millet, mustard seeds, poppy seeds, triticale meal, rye meal, malted wheat flakes, oats, brown rice meal, and barley flakes).  Then the next ""ingredient"" is enriched flour.<br /><br />The problem is that there is no way to determine whether the first ""ingredient"" is 80% of the total recipe or 40% -- and no way of knowing, within that amount, how much is in each sub-ingredient.  I suspect that they did this unusual grouping of ingredients to hide their recipe -- but, as noted by the other reviewer's reaction, it may very well be counter-productive. If they had split out the set of ingredients into their separate parts, one would have a much better idea as to how it is made.<br /><br />I have been counseled that I am pre-diabetic.  For me, therefore, it is very important to keep up the dietary fiber in the carbohydrates that I eat (slows digestion, keeps insulin levels steadier).  Looking through my local supermarket, the GrainsFirst crackers was the only cracker & cheese type of cracker that met the criteria of 2g dietary fiber or more per serving (they actually list exactly 2g).  It's tasty and it fits my dietary needs (sure, I'd rather have 3 or 4g -- work with what one can get).<br /><br />There are other crackers that meet the dietary criteria -- like Triscuits and a few others -- but they aren't really the same category of cracker in my opinion.<br /><br />Worth some extra money -- but you may be able to beat the price from Amazon if you can find them locally."

My breakfast every single work day consists of a standard Clif Bar, and I also occasionally eat a Clif Builder's Bar after a strenuous workout. Happy with all previous Clif products, I purchased a couple boxes of these Clif Crunch Bars, in the Chocolate Chip flavor. Like other Clif products, the whole ingredients list consists of real, natural items; nothing on the list that you can't pronounce or identify.<br /><br />If this review were based on taste and taste alone, there is no doubt in my mind that these bars would deserve a full 5 stars. Given that the bars are relatively healthy, with a solid ingredients list, they taste wonderful; I wouldn't have them change a single thing. Unfortunately, the big downside to this product is the fact that they just aren't nearly as filling as other Clif products. Each pack contains two separate bars, and as far as satisfying hunger goes, I need to eat two complete packs of these Crunch Bars to get the same amount of satisfaction as a single normal Clif bar.

I have been a long time buyer of Eden Organic Matcha, but it was just getting too expensive for me to drink daily using 1/2 to 1 tsp per day.  The first replacement I tried out was a ""culinary"" grade tea by SerendipiTea.  I wasn't sure what to expect from it, but figured I would at least be able to put it into smoothies if I totally hated it.  I totally hated it.  The Eden Matcha was a beautiful, vibrant green while the SerendipiTea was almost brown.  Blech.  And the flavor....I couldn't even handle it in a smoothie, it tasted like dirt and made everything I put the tea in taste like dirt.  I was a little gun shy after that because Matcha is just so expensive and very difficult to find organically grown.  The DoMatcha seemed to be my only other option.  I am glad I finally took the plunge because it is a good substitute for the Eden brand.  I get almost three ounces for a similar price as 1 ounce of Eden.  I was happy as soon as I opened the bag inside the tin....the powder is a gorgeous emerald color.  It doesn't taste quite as good as the Eden (a bit more pungent and grassy), but it is good and I feel the same sense of vitality and cleansing I got from the Eden tea. I am a happy camper.<br /><br />NOTE:  I do not prepare and drink this Matcha in a traditional way. While I love green tea (and tea of all kinds), I drink Matcha specifically for the health benefits of consuming the whole tea leaf and don't muck around with water of a specific temperature and bamboo whisks. I add 1/2 tsp to cool water first thing in the morning in a shaker cup and shake vigorously. To me it is a lovely, frothy way to start my day.  I also put a bit in my smoothies."

The small bags are a bit pricey BUT they're not made in China.  My brother always insisted that we only buy dog food made in the USA when we had our three labs.  Now I have a beagle and a blue heeler with my guy, and we are always trying to treat them for good behavior.  I found and buy these at Petco.  The bag has more content than the usual packs of Freebirds, and they like them as well, but I didn't realize until reading other reviewer comments where they came from.  Filled with condroitin and glucosamine for the mature dog with hip problems (the blue heeler), I thought I'd give them a try.  Though I don't see any distinct improvement in our 12 year-old Sydney's hips, I don't see anything detrimental either.  They come to the cupboard after coming in from outside or a bath just as before and gobble them down like a kid with candy.  The China factor makes me a little uneasy, especially at that price, but I see no ill effects thus far.  I asked my vet today what she thought, and she said that they're probably fine as long as they're not recalled, but the laws in China are less strict about what they put in their products.  It makes me wonder if I want to risk my dogs being a recall factor if that should happen, so use your own judgement.

The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing. However, on the downside, I would not recommend that you make this tea with water alone, although it is a very smooth tea, it lacks body - thus, like I said before, make it as follows:<br /><br />Steep in 4oz hot water with 2 teaspoons of cane sugar (or substitute your own)<br />Add 4oz warm milk<br /><br />The milk as I said gives it extra body that the tea lacks, however it is forgiveable.

Prince of Peace can barely get away with calling this Pu-erh because it is of such low quality.  If you really want to enjoy an exquisite cup of Pu-erh, try the higher quality loose or cake type Pu-erh.  It's a little more work to brew properly but the benefits and superior taste are well worth the cost and your time.  In a pinch, you can brew the tea leaves in a drip coffee maker.  When the brewing stops, carefully lift out the coffee filter with the wet leaves, tie it closed with a piece of string and hang it over the side of the pot so the packet is in the tea.  Steep it for 3 to 5 minutes on the heat plate of the coffee maker.<br /><br />As for the health benefits, I've never experienced such dramatic results so quickly.  The second day after I started drinking a better quality Pu-erh tea my high blood pressure was gone and so was my expensive prescription!  I was absolutely amazed at the fast results and an added benefit is that it is the best tasting tea on the planet.  I have never found any tea that has the natural sweetness of Pu-erh and the exotic, earthy taste is almost intoxicating.  I expected something this healthy to taste awful or, at best, tolerable but the opposite was true.  Some of the other health benefits may take longer to become obvious, but even if my lowered blood pressure is the only benefit that results from drinking this tea, I will be overjoyed.  If you've never tried it, do yourself a favor and shell out the bucks for the high-quality Pu-erh.  If you are drinking it to loose weight or burn fat, try brewing a 6-cup pot using equal parts Pu-erh, white and green teas.  They are all beneficial to your health and will help you attain your weight loss goals faster.  They taste great together too but you can drink them separately if you prefer.  Then drink a cup or two of chickweed tea in the afternoon to help remove the toxins from your colon.<br /><br />I wanted to give this product one star because of the low quality, but since it is Pu-erh and the taste is acceptable, I am giving it two stars.  If you want to try the better quality Pu-erh, buy a package from rishi-tea.com or teagarden.com. I like the option of buying different sized packages of tea offered by rishi-tea.com.  I also recommend the brewing instructions video on YouTube by Doctor Tea.  Try the real deal and you won't mind paying more."

(So far I have tried the One a Day - yes the same as the vitamin maker.) I was hoping I would like this one since I didn't like the other kind.  So take this into consideration with my review.<br /><br />Instead of pouring the packet into a water bottle, I filled a Guinness pint glass about 3/4 of the way full and added some ice before adding the packet.  I wasn't really sure how much water was the appropriate amount to be mixed.  I was delighted by the hot pink foamy action at the top of the glass, but after stirring it around with a spoon, the foam quickly disappeared and the powder all dissolved into the water.<br /><br />On the plus side, the powder all dissolves.  There is no junk left at the bottom of the glass.  The color is very bright pink - almost fuchsia.  It seems a little artificial to me, but I'm not sure if it's a natural color for the pomegranate.  The very first taste was really good.  After the first sip, however, I realized it was going to take a lot for me to drink the entire glass.  It might be easier to drink this while you're working out very hard and are super thirsty and are more apt to take big, quick gulps.  There's also a little bit of a funky smell to it when my nose enters the glass.  This may not be so much of an issue if you're drinking out of a water bottle where you nose doesn't catch much of a whiff.<br /><br />To give a fair review, I thought I'd let my seven year old taste this concoction.  Maybe I'm just too old for the overly sweet taste?  Verdict? Seven year old didn't like it either.  I won't be buying this in the future."

They have good marketing and packaging to make you think it is high quality when it is actually the exact opposite. The same can be said for IAMs. Eukanuba gave my perfectly healthy boston terrier skin problems which although weren't his cause of death, it was the first domino that led to his death. If I had not fed him this junk, he would still be alive today. Im not a random case. The problem is byproducts, fillers and the use of corn.

172871,B000FAIRCI,A3E4J5MXHB4LYB,Megan Johnson,0,0,5,1292198400,So good.,"I've purchased this product numerous times at my local grocery stores, and normally it runs about $4 a box. That is a bit pricey for a sauce packet and some cheap noodles, but it is so convenient and tasty that I continued to purchase it until they stopped selling it.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't think I would eat this without adding at least one vegetable and one protein to it. It is not a meal in a box, but a meal building block. I would normally sautee some onion, chicken, water chestnuts, and asparagus spears, add the sauce, and noodles. It is also very good with chicken and snow peas. It would probably be good with shrimp as well.<br /><br />I am fairly particular about boxed food, I don't ever eat Hamburger Helper because I don't like reconstituted sauces. I find this sauce to be very good, however, and the convenience aspect puts it over the top. As far as the other reviews noted about the spice level, I do agree that it is spicier than I'd expect to come out of a box, but not overpoweringly spicy. I've had spicier dishes from many Thai restaurants, and I've never ordered anything over ""medium"" spice level. I'm not sure about the serving amount if you add nothing to it, but with some chicken and vegetables, it will serve 2 average eaters with no leftovers. I've never finished it all by myself. All in all, this is the best meal I've cooked (partially) out of a box. Although to be fair, I do most of my cooking from scratch.<br /><br />Hope this helps!"

This is the same product you'll find in Japanese homes and supermarkets.<br /><br />Many people are unaware of just how popular curry is in Japan. Frequently served in homes, restaurants, and schools, curry rice is so commonly-eaten and loved that it can be considered a third national dish, right after sushi and ramen. Introduced to Japan during the Meiji Era (1860's) by the British, curry was at first only affordable to the wealthy, appearing in gourmet restaurants in Ginza and other fine dining establishments, but now it's very ubiquitous and eaten frequently by young and old. Curry is filling, easy to make, nutritious, versatile, and can feed many people for very little money, not to mention delicious.<br /><br />Inside the box are solid, dry cubes of roux, arranged sort of like an ice cube tray. Preparation is so easy that kids often make this on camping trips. You simply break off as many pieces as you need, brown some meat (usually pork when I was living in Tokyo), add the roux and water, then simmer it with your choice of vegetables until tender. Usually, this is carrots, potatoes, onions. Sometimes apples are added.<br /><br />Japanese curry is more liquidy than curries served in typical Indian restaurants in the US, sort of like a rich brown gravy. It goes over rice, or sometimes udon. When served on rice, it is accompanied by a heaping spoonful of chopped pickles like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LDFRE"">Daikon Takuan Pickle -7oz</a>. Japanese levels of spiciness are typically much lower than American tolerances, so ""Hot"" is not really that hot.<br /><br />The Amazon price is reasonable, especially if you live outside of large East Asian urban centers, where Japanese foodstuffs can be hard to find."

But I am not sure if it's the natural sugar from the banana. I have many different treats for them before but this treat seems to make them super ""high"" and they had to race many laps in the yard to get off that energy.  Maybe someone who has the same experience can comment on this observation.  Overall, I am satisfied with the price of the item.

The price was so reasonable that it encouraged me to try them in many different ways. So far I've made a batch of Kahlua, a batch of vanilla extract, and a batch of homemade granola using these beans. And STILL have 8 left. I'm going to chop a bean up finely and add it to the heated milk I use for homemade yogurt. I'm guessing that will be yummy. Very pleased with this purchase - the quality is superb.<br /><br />For those having storage issues, the proper way to store vanilla beans is to wrap each vanilla bean separately in plastic wrap, expelling all the air, and then put all the wrapped beans in a plastic bag (also expelling all the air) and store in your pantry or other dark cool location. Every month, take the beans out, unwrap them, let them air for 15 minutes or so, then wrap back up and store. I've never had one go bad doing this."

That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity."

This is an issue if you are giving this to kids to use.<br />In Europe they make ""koolaid"" with concentrated sugar solutions.

They stay crispy for a long time (much longer than Cheerios) and the flavor is very nice.  The corn overtones are more subtle when mixed with milk so I get a similar taste to Honey Nut Cherios but with a hint of different flavor due to the corn base.

Very sad...if Royal was smart, they'd focus on marketing Dark & Sweet as their only chocolate. (perhaps it was too confusing to offer two chocolate flavors? My guess is, due to lack of shelf space, many stores never bothered to carry both--in fact, when asked, many managers seemed unaware there even WAS another Royal chocolate flavor offered) If stores carried Dark and Sweet, and the public became aware of it, they would blow Jello and other lesser brands out of the water.

They are dry squares with a look and feel of thick crackers. Once you open the bag, there are many pieces, but there is a line through the center which means that you can break them in half pretty easily. This extends the amount of them you can use by two.<br /><br />I cannot vouch for how they taste but they certainly attract my dog and she is very attentive when I bring the bag out.

Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.

After only a couple of weeks of use the difference is amazing!  I am so thrilled.  Obviously, it didn't fix my split ends (I have trimmed those) but the dryness has improved drastically.  What I have been doing is applying it to my hair, more concentrated at the ends, and leaving it in for a few hours before washing it out and then conditioning with regular conditioner.  My hair is SO shiny but not oily.  (Be careful not to use too much though because then it will be a little oily.

Next I tried it as an iced tea.  I enjoyed the sweet yet sour taste much better this way.  It also looked very pretty in the clear glass with its beautiful color.<br /><br />This is not a bad tea, but it is not really the kind of tea I go for.  I prefer it cold to hot and I would be careful of how much sweetener you add to it. Maybe half a packet will do ya.  I don't think I would buy it again, but I am not going to throw it in the trash either.  I wanted to love it so I am sad I do not."

What I now know is that  tons of protein is not always the best for every breed.  I started my three little dogs cavapoo 15 lbs cavachon 12 lb yorkie 5 lbs on Wellness Core which is I'm sure a wonderful food but the protein is rated at 36% which turned out to be far to rich for my little dogs. After talking with the breeder of my yorkie she explained that too much protein in some breeds can be taxing on the liver and kidneys. I saw this in my dogs right away so I knew I had to make a quick change.  I definately wanted to eliminate the gas and copious amount of poop do to the protein content so I checked with the other foods made by Wellness and found that the simple five mix has a lot of the same wonderful ingredients as the Core but with a much more practical protein content for my dogs life style at 28%.  The results were amazing, immediately I saw a reduction in the amount of poop fewer times outside as well.  Everybody seems happier and life is easier with all three dogs on the same kibble.  I'm THRILLED.  Thank You WELLNESS.  I would strongly recommend this product.  One more side note...I really appreciate the promise made by Wellness on the front of the bag.

They're a staple of my diet and have helped me maintain my weight and never gain a pound. The very first organic raw honey I ever tried was by YS organics and I was unimpressed. I stopped buying from them when I found better options (also, I was pretty mad when I found out I unknowingly ordered the non-organic YS honey jars -- I didn't realize there was a difference.) YS honey is cheap, and you get a lot more of it for your buck, and I would probably still buy it if I didn't do research on metal lids and plastisol food liners (plastisol contains PVC; it's bad for you.) I now try to find glass jars with safe plastic lids, and this one fit the bill perfectly.<br /><br />This just arrived at my door via a Vitacost purchase. I immediately tore through all the bubble-wrap and opened the jar to find a lovely 'capping' or 'crust' as some call it. I dug into the crust and tried it, was reminded of honey comb chewy-ness and then proceeded to dig in further to try the very smooth and firm raw honey beneath the crust. It tastes like an improved version of YS honey. While very similar, the texture is better and so is the flavor. I found YS to be cloyingly sweet, and this one is slightly toned down.<br /><br />I would recommend this over YS. If you are on a budget then buying the big glass jar of ORGANIC YS is the smarter option. I do not like YS lids, so I will not be buying any YS honey during hot months.<br /><br />Lighter honeys are not my favorite. I prefer a dark honey for the flavor and UMF benefits, but dark honeys come from far across the world and you can never be too sure what happened to it between harvesting and packing. I really appreciate knowing where this honey has been. I don't have to worry about it being thrown into an aluminum barrel and shipped off to a packing company where it would be heated before it could be put into jars.<br /><br />This is a great honey, and you should definitely try it.<br /><br />I'm sorry if the pictures I posted are blurry. I have shaky hands that are bad for taking pictures with!"

One tip (this is also on the box) is that if your loaf lasts more than 2-3 days, slice it and store it in the freezer.  It will stay fresher that way.

I can say it's weak because in order to fill my 14 oz ""cup"" I brewed *two* K-cups - one 6 oz. and one 8 oz. - likely smaller than most people would brew.  It was still weak.  I suspect that if I had brewed two 4 oz. cups it would still have tasted like raspberry water to me, because of the flavoring itself.  Not sure what I'll do with the remainder.

Do your research!,"This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month."

My 5 yr old dog gets yearly cleanings but he was still getting bad breath type issues; the little one just turned 2 and he doesn't have these problems - yet. I decided to buy this product because it can be substituted for treats and contains Chlorhexidine which the Vet said is a special added ingredient needed for good teeth and breath.  I strongly believe the chews have substantially improved my dog's breath.<br /><br />Besides the oral benefits, the dogs are very happy when I ask them if they want ""chips"" (which is what I call the ""chews"".  The dogs lick them all over and I'd say for every 2 out of 3 they will keep at the chip until gone.  It takes over a few hours for the bigger dog to finish one. Be advised that these chips have a really strong, pungent odor but absolutely do not leave stains on fabric which is really important. Over time I've come to like the odd smell.<br /><br />The only thing I strongly dislike about the product is its really hard for me to open the bag; it is sturdy plastic with a resealable plastic zip but its so tight near the pull apart zip that it's hard to get to open.<br /><br />I recommend this product and order two bags at a time.

All of the dogs figured the puzzle out within minutes, and each has their own style. My Rott paws it open, bashing it with his giant paws. My Lab nosed it for a while, then picked it up and tossed it. My friend's Terrier mix nosed it open. This is a great way to keep the dogs thinking and to give an outlet for some mental energy.

I needed something that would benefit different age stages nutritionally, in bulk, for the best price. This is what I based my research on and came up with this dog food. One of my dogs, full grown and used to eating different brands of junk before I knew what I was feeding him, was not too fond of it at first but got used to it and now he eats it without any issue. My puppy loves it and will overstuff herself if I do not ration for meal times. It gives me peace of mind that they both are getting what they need and I am not going broke giving it to them. My only complaint is the horrid flatulence this dog food seems to give them. I have never experienced that with my adult dog in the 4 years he's been with me but then again he has always eaten the store brands of dog food so maybe that's the issue? Overall, I am satisfied and can live with the occasional unpleasantness for a few seconds if it means they are eating healthy. There is also a NOTICEABLE difference in their coats and health. So that's another plus. I couldn't in good conscience give it five just because the flatulence really is 'room clearing'.......S'pose that could have it's uses for unwanted guests on the bright side."

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness."

It is easily the best price fair trade and organic option on the market, unless you want something flavorless.<br /><br />I primarily make espresso and this bean puts all others to shame. It takes an average-fineness grind, fine but not powdery, and preferably a HOT portafilter. Double shots are best, as it really needs to heat up to get a fine emulsion and delivers excellent crema. Fantastic as espresso, with rich chocolatey notes and a superbly smooth feel. My wife, who enjoys cream and sugar with a bit of coffee, loves this in a latte with 1 part espresso and only 2 parts milk (usual latte is about 1 to 6). After using this for the past few months, when travelling and stopping at Starbucks or Caribou, it's disgusting to drink what used to pass for good coffee. This is the best bean you could ever want.<br /><br />On occassion, I've also brewed using a French press and, naturally, the result was fabulous. I usually find brewed coffee quite lacking in body and flavor, but this was rich, flavorful, and absent of acidity. I actually found it to taste best after steeping for 10-15 minutes, much longer than called for.<br /><br />Obviously this is for people who really love strong coffee. It is a dark, dark roast but the balance of body and acidity makes it a versatile option for the skilled barista.<br /><br />Still yet to check out the 454 Horespower roast, could be even better, but can't compare to the great value of Kick Ass.

These have only 130 calories so it can be a snack (if a protein bar gets to be too high in calories it really ought to be a meal replacement) and these are chocolatey enough to satisfy my chocolate craving.  These have 3 grams of fiber, not so much, but then these are not trying to be fiber bars.  These bars have 9 grams of protein, not bad, but it appears to be all soy based, but since it is not SO much protein I guess that is fine (too much soy is not good).  There is some palm oil which I am not a fan of (not ecologically sound and it is cholesterol raising), but few processed foods out there are perfect.  I would recommend these to anyone who needs a little something sweet and chocolatey that is low enough in calories to be a snack and who isn't so hung up on natural/organic foods.

I've only tried the Italian and Columbia varieties.  The convenience is a major factor, and it beats the pants off anything ""instant"" I've ever had before.  Great for backpacking.  The ability to do a 50-count bulk purchase is the way to go, though, as buying 3-packs locally is steep--but perhaps not so much when one considers the price of a cup of the real thing.  My only beef is that my most recent purchase had a ""best by"" date just 2.5 months away (a complaint I've seen others make).  I spoke with a Starbucks rep who claimed it was still going to be fine for some unspecified time beyond that date, that they'd take my return if desired, but that they couldn't promise that the date on whatever replacement shipped from the warehouse would be any further distant.  Kind of lame...but I'm going through it quickly enough that the question is probably moot."

I guess the bonus here would be that if you like a more subtle, less sweet vanilla flavoring to your coffee the package will last you that much longer when you blend it with something non-flavored!<br /><br />I give it a 3-star rating because to me, it's just OK.  I can't say I like it, but I don't dislike it either.<br /><br />The packaging says 'an accent of vanilla' and 'an understated vanilla highlight'.  I'd beg to differ.  I'd say something like infused with a 'strong vanilla overtone'.  The ground coffee contains ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root.<br /><br />Maybe it's the root that does it?  Whatever it is, be prepared to enjoy this arabica coffee only if you really enjoy sweet, intense vanilla flavor."

Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for over 3 months.  I've consulted with my Vet, Animal Shelter, and Obedience Trainer who trained dogs in the military for 20 years; ALL agreed that this is a good and safe product BUT like anything else you give you puppy/dog SHOULD be supervised AND timed.  They also all agreed that the limit on giving these chews should be between 10-20 minutes and either taken away for future use, or the remainder thrown away.  If you are a SMART pet owner, you will be supervising the use of this product and if after 10 minutes, the product is beginning to be swallowed, I guess it makes sense to take the product away.  These work exactly for what they are intended, to reduce and remove tarter and plaque.  It is NOT a treat or toy!  As much as it CAN be digested, yes, some dogs will try to swallow too big a bite and begin to choke.  As pet owners, again, supervision is needed.  Remember, I have TWO pups, and after 15-20 minutes, all I need to say is ""drop it"" and they listen and do so because I am also a RESPONSIBLE pet owner and have already begun training them to listen.  If the chews aren't too badly mangled, I save for the next/another day, otherwise, they get trashed.  The only other note I will also agree on is the lack of consistency in size/shape of these chews.  Great product otherwise."

None of the recipes were nearly as good, however, as the spiced-just-right vindaloo I used to order at least once a week from Baluchi's when I lived in New York City.<br /><br />During my recipe experimentation, I visited a local Asian grocery store and asked the clerk for some advice. He recommended trying Patak's paste. I was dubious, but I did. It was absolutely great. And the bonus: The Patak's recipe is much easier to fix than the various recipes I had been collecting.<br /><br />I've cooked with this paste so often now, I've learned to make a few alterations to the recipe. I basically follow the directions on the jar (substituting chicken for shrimp), but add a 1/4 cup of yogurt and about a tablespoon of fresh minced cilantro at the end of the cooking process. If I have some lemon juice around, I put in a couple of squirts just before serving. (I usually cook the dish with two to two-and-a-half pounds of chicken and freeze the leftovers. It reheats well.)<br /><br />If you're using chicken breasts rather than dark meat, make sure not to overcook and dry out the chicken. That's about the only thing you'll need to guard against. (A friend told me to marinate the chicken bits in yogurt and then cook them under a broiler, separate from the sauce but adding them to the sauce once they're cooked through. He says this locks in the moistness and adds a little flavor to the meat via the slight charring/carmelization that results. I haven't tried it, but it sounds good.)<br /><br />By the way, I'm not sure how healthy this paste is; don't overuse the paste or the dish can get a bit greasy, for example. (There must be a fair amount of oil in the paste.) Just use the amount recommended on the jar and you should be fine.<br /><br />Patak's doesn't beat Baluchi's chicken vindaloo, but for a home cook looking to make fast and tasty vindaloos, this paste can't be beat.<br /><br />Now if I could just learn to make a quick-and-easy naan, I'd really be in business..."

At that time, the 3 Musketeers were three little candy bars with different flavored nougat - chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. Well, it was found that the chocolate was by far the most popular, so the other bars went away, and the 3 Musketeers became one bar.<br /><br />3 Musketeers is a great, soft candy bar that weighs in at 2.13 ounces, and has 260 calories and 8 grams of fat. It does not contain nuts, which makes it a good choice in case anyone you know has a nut allergy, and it does not contain caramel, which makes it a good choice for kids with braces. (Heck, when I had my braces, 3 Musketeers became my candy bar of choice, and it still has a favored spot in my sweet-tooth!)<br /><br />This is a great tasting candy bar, and a good choice if you are buying candy bars for others - such as a soccer team, or whatnot.

I think a lot of that depends on your own personal body chemistry, so if you need a sugar replacement you should try a lot of small amounts of the different sugar alcohols. For me, maltitol and sorbitol are awful, but xylitol is just fine. Of all the sugar replacements I have tried, I think xylitol tastes the most like sugar. It has a nice, grainy texture like sugar does, which makes it appealing for applications like sprinkling it on fruit, and it isn't overly-sweet the way I find most sugar replacements are. If anything, I would say measure for measure it is slightly less sweet than sugar, which I actually like as I'm trying to reduce my sweet tooth in general.<br /><br />HOWEVER, EVERYONE WHO OWNS A DOG NEEDS TO BE AWARE THAT XYLITOL IS DEADLY TO DOGS. I am not some weirdo posting rumors - please google xylitol dogs and the very first entry is from Snopes.com stating that this is true. As little as 3 grams can kill a 65 pound dog.<br /><br />I still use XyloSweet all the time; I am just very, very careful when I use it when my dog is around because he's a floor-licking sort of guy. And while I never give him people-food, I know others often do and you obviously can't do that with anything you've made with Xylitol.<br /><br />Please, please upvote this review if you can - I'm concerned that no warning appears on the bag or in the company's copy and that none of the highly-voted reviews discuss this issue. It is very easy to prevent what could be a deadly accident for your dog!"

It's the latest rave and so good for you. This product also smells so deliciously wonderful, like a coconut/pineapple tropical delight!

I've been really looking at ingredients closely these days and did the same with this product.<br /><br />First ingredient Mineral Oil. Not the greatest stuff since is it a by-product of distillation of gasoline and considered a carcinogenic by some people.<br /><br />Second, HYDROGENATED Coconut Oil. What does that mean? I know coconut oil in it's raw form is really good in our diets and on our skin. After some google research I found out that Hydrogentated Coconut Oil is created by heating to 500-1000 degrees, then a catalyst is injected. The catalyst is typically nickel, platinum, or even aluminum! This stuff is bad for you! It is closer to plastic than a good for you organic compound.<br /><br />Sure, you're not putting it IN YOUR BODY, but there is some absorption that takes place when you squeeze it in your hands and through you scalp.<br /><br />Third ingredient, even worse! Styrene Butadiene Copolymer. Labeled as BHT and most people don't notice this ingredient or even think anything of it. It's Synthetic Rubber used in CAR TIRES, yuck! Embalming fluid, even more yuck! It has been associated to child hyper-activity and cancer.<br /><br />I just can't give this item a good review. It's not even Gluten Free since it has Wheat Germ Oil. Other ingredients are good, like Sweet Almond Oil and Aloe.<br /><br />This product feels really nice in my hair and I will use in on an OCCASSIONAL basis, but not on a daily basis.

And there is just a touch of salt - just enough to bring out the YUM without overdoing it.<br /><br />Finally, the package size.

In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them."

I have a 4 month old Lhasa Apso and he licks his bowl well after he has finished eating. When I first got him the breeder had him on Purina Puppy Chow. The first thing I wanted to do was to switch him to a high quality, no grain diet and after alot of research and reviews,Taste of The Wild always came on top(dollar wise). After the switch I immediately noticed a difference in my puppy.His coat is starting to shine and is sooooo soft to the touch. He has so much energy now and he has less eye discharge and less ear odor(due to being allergic to the Puppychow)."

This caused the mixture to geyser upward and hit me in the face, instead of spraying out of the nozzle.<br /><br />I immediately went inside and showered and washed out my mouth (yes, my mouth happened to be open when the valve popped off).

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed.  My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it.  Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped.  I tried another bag last week-- same results.  Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months.  No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners.  Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address.  I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems.  I've changed my dogs to Eagle Pack Holistic Selects. It's more expensive, but they are back to their old selves-- healthy, no digestive troubles, and great coats."

This is so almondy and sweet on its own (I haven't added any sugar), it's like eating an almond cookie, or a big hunk of marzipan. You can still taste the matcha, though, and it's a flavor that goes well with the almond. I do think. Ok, I couldn't resist adding just a touch of sugar (half teaspoon), and holy crap, is this like almondy matcha candy. It makes me think that this would be a good addition to a sugar cookie as opposed to almond extract to make a matcha almond cookie.

Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors."

Were very pleasantly surprised. I almost exclusively eat Quaker apple cinnamon oatmeal, but I really liked this brand.<br /><br />I have to comment on the great packaging idea of this product comes in. First, if you care it's post have lower amount of packaging than comparable products and be better for the environment. Anyway, the thing I really do like about this is the pouches are also the measuring cup. You take a bowl, tear the pouch open, dump out the contents, then you fill be empty pouch with water up to a line on the pouch, dump it in the bowl, stir and then nuke it for 90 seconds. I don't know why nobody is ever thought of this before in any of the packaging I've seen, but it saves the guessing at how much water to put in or caring stupid measuring cup around with you if you're eating it work like I do. My only minor gripe is the line it asks you to tear at isn't the area that had the tear point so I mistook the tear line for the fill line and put in too much water the first four or five times I used it.<br /><br />When we went back to the store we picked up another three boxes pulled me out for the next few weeks.

I only use about 1/2-3/4 of the flavored salt because I think using all of it makes the popcorn too salty for me. The quality of the kernels is excellent. They pop quite big and aren't too chewy.

I have 3 dogs: a 14yr old Bichon and 2 18month old pit bulls (litter sisters). I initally purchased these treats for the pits when we first got them when they were puppies - like 8wks old.  With these treats I have taught them to sit, stay, down, and best of all, KENNEL.  They were kennel trained and that's where they sleep.  They also have a large dog run out in the yard and I get them in there with the treats too.  The minute they hear that bag, they sit. The Bichon is 14. She doesn't need a treat to sit or go to bed but she gets one just the same because if she doesn't, she whines.<br />These are also fantastic if you have to give your dog medication.  I tried hot dogs and cheese and Gracie (one of the pits) would just spit out the pill.  So...I tried a treat and down it went.<br />When the puppies got older and bigger (one is 70pds and the other is 65pds) I saw that they make treats for bigger dogs but all my girls love these.  I don't feel bad giving these treats to any of them.<br />I would DEFINITELY recommend to any pet owner."

You do not have to smoke and, I also have done in my oven (convection oven works best), or a combo - where I cold smoke, then finish in the oven, where I can really control the exact temp.

European crisp-breads.  These crackers are made from three simple ingredients: whole grain rye flour, sesame seeds and salt.  One reason I got them is that I avoid eating yeast, but I think that the ""Sesame Rye"" crackers would fit into just about any special diet.<br /><br />When I bit into the cracker, I was pleasantly surprised by the texture. At first I was afraid that they'd taste dry and hard. But it is light and airy, with a gentle kind of crispiness that sort of melts in your mouth. Also the sesame seeds are a nice touch. I don't know how they got it so light and crispy like that without using yeast!<br /><br />The flavor is also quite pleasing.  Rye is a good grain to add to your diet for health and variety.  Unfortunately,  I do not like the taste of most rye products, esp. bread because of the caraway seeds in them.  Ryvita rye crackers combine three ingredients into a cracker that is tasty and healthy.  There's great to snack on alone or with any spread or topper you want.<br /><br />I purchased a box of them for $2.49 from my local health food store, so I was happy to see them here for such a good price, and I ordered a case of them.  I hope that you like them, too."

I initially was looking for the beans alone but when I read the label and since I only use brown rice now a days, we gave this combination a shot and for us, it paid off! I can cook all manners of legumes, beans, etc but hey, if a nice organic company wants to do it for a while for an acceptable price, why not? For sure 4 Stars or even higher, they are reliable fare but for a couple of weird reasons we ended up with 6 cases of different kinds so we are still figuring how are we going to consume so much since most of the times we are only 2 people. That is the beauty of canned food, I guess, that it does keep longer and well. 4 Stars!"

408745,B000EPS9KE,AUAWPV7UYOZES,Richmix,12,13,5,1260316800,Great dark tea,"I learned to love English ""black"" teas drinking Tetley during a study abroad trip in London. The taste is unlike anything found in coffee shops or grocery store shelves in the States. Tetley, like Typhoo, has an impressively strong English Breakfast taste--so strong that I found myself using 5-6 English breakfast teabags after my return to the US simply *trying* (and failing) to duplicate the flavor. After many unsuccessful attempts, I was disappointed to find that Tetley was not available at Costco World Market or any other import stores in my area. Reluctant to ask my British friends to mail me some, I decided to try the only brand that was available, which was Typhoo. This stuff, in my opinion, is very similar to but ever so slightly better than Tetley.<br /><br />For those who haven't tried this ""kind"" of tea before, I'll describe it in a word as being very heavy. One teabag can powerfully flavor a large American mug of water--far more, thankfully, than the 8-ounce maxim most instant beverage companies push. Its taste, like I've said, is similar to a very strong English Breakfast tea, but that taste is so strong that I personally would hesitate to call it by that name. It's an altogether different kind of tea in my opinion, labeled on the bag simply as ""black tea,"" reminiscent only (in my experience) of Tetley and PG-Tips. With just water, it produces a rich, slightly bitter drink with a somewhat fruity aftertaste. Adding cold milk to the already-steeped drink can smooth the tart taste a bit (as well as cool the drink if you're not one for piping hotness). Adding sugar to either the dark or ""white"" versions can change the flavor more than you'd expect, too. The first cup of Tetley I ever drank had *a lot* of milk and sugar in it, and the taste wasn't ruined at all: it tasted very much like a sweet and mild desert drink, something like cocoa (only with a completely different flavor). The same, I've found, is true of Typhoo. I've not tried it with honey, lemon, or any other additions.<br /><br />The teabags diffuse their flavor FAST. If you're one to microwave your water (blasphemous in all parts of the world except America, and with good reason, you might know, if you've ever tried tea made with stovetop- or kettle-boiled water), you can have a cup ready in about two minutes. Electric kettles are available too that are designed specifically for boiling water and can accomplish the task faster and better than a microwave. (These products, incidentally, are great for anyone who drinks lots of hot beverages of any kind: though the devices' directions will tell you to only use them to heat water, I regularly boil milk and other non-viscous liquids in mine without problems.) To help with the steeping process, put the teabag in an empty mug or cup and pour the hot water over the bag. The water will immediately begin turning a dark amber color. After a few seconds, if the water is stirred, the diffusion process will speed up, and before you know it, poof! You have a very dark bronze, almost black, cup of tea with the strongest flavor you could hope for. Great for the office or people on the go.<br /><br />Sadly, to me at least, this tea tastes horrible when cold. If you have a tendency to let your hot drinks sit undrank until they are no longer hot drinks (oh, the tragedy!), you may be disappointed in the consequences of inattention to this cuppa. The actual flavor doesn't change much, if at all, but the strong punch this beverage packs is far better suited for a hot drink than a cold one, a problem this tea's weaker English Breakfast competitors don't face. Though this is an opinion, my advice is to not allow this (or any other tea) to become cold, if only for the fact that drinking hot tea which, through apathy, preoccupation, or forgetfulness, has been forced to watch teary-eyed as its hotness slips away, is the most cruel sort of ridiculous. Be kind to your tea and drink it fast, lest it begin to believe it is not tea at all, but perhaps some mutated spawn of the Kool-Aid Man.<br /><br />Ergo, this product makes for an excellent meal tea or desert drink, though not necessarily for breakfast on account of its heady flavor. Oh, and this is a good tea for English biscuits, too, though I would only drink it with the plain ones. (Chocolate doesn't get on well with this stuff.)"

My wife bought this mix because it was the only one available at Trader Joe's when she shopped.  She didn't tell me they were fat free, but as soon as I tried one, I knew.  It had all the hallmarks of fat-free baked goods - gummy, flat, and the chocolate tasted like cocoa powder, not like rich fudgy chocolate.  I almost had to spit it out, it was that awful.<br /><br />And do you want to know why fat free foods taste so bad?  I'll let you in on a little secret:  the secret ingredient in good-tasting food is... you guessed it - FAT!!!!!  Fat and oil molecules transport the lovely taste of foods onto your taste buds.  So stop being so afraid of fat!  A little bit won't kill you!  Just exercise a little self-control and don't eat the entire box.  One properly made brownie is more satisfying than a whole plate of these vile things.<br /><br />So if you like real food that tastes good, don't believe the reviewers that raved about these brownies.  These people have a hidden agenda - they are trying to convince themselves that these little nuggets of evil actually taste good and are good for them."

It has the perfect amount of caffeine to not cause headaches and it is really good for you -- if you don't sweeten it.  Tea has been shown to prevent cancer and diabetes!  Brew some Luzianne and you'll never look back!<br /><br />Just a helpful tip:<br /><br />I have tried several different brewing methods -- stovetop boiling, microwave boiling, iced tea maker -- but the best one that works is just heating the water until it is hot (not boiling).  I've had problems with it coming out too strong and this is just right.  Let it steep for the full 5 minutes."

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as ""cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice"" and ""medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, spice"". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea ""blend"" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.<br /><br />The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****"

As stated in the product description, this is not a K-cup but a pre-measured packet designed for Keurig brewers.  The taste is classic Ghiradelli: rich, sweet and heavy on the chocolate.  When I made a single cup of hot cocoa for a discriminating adult I reach for this one.  However, I find K-cups to be more convenient (especially when making beverages for a lot of people) and children seem to like all of them (and the sweeter the better).<br /><br />If I am serving hot chocolate to a group I will do it the traditional way but when I offer hot beverages to a guest and they are not interested in coffee or tea I am glad that I have Ghiradelli's hot cocoa on hand.

After being on medication for some time for unpleasant heart palpitations (which never worked too well), I decided to give this supplement a try. In about 2 months, the palpitations were completely gone, and I don't have to take that horrible drug anymore! This stuff is awesome. This was about a year ago. I have come to realize that doctors know nothing about caring for the human body and know very little about real nutrition. Your just a customer to them; they make their money by prescribing dangerous drugs that only mask symptoms but don't correct the problem at its source. Magnesium is so important for the body - you cannot go wrong with this supplement. Most people are deficient in this important mineral because the land is so devoid of important minerals these days, so it's very hard to get from food alone. This is the best magnesium supplement on the market. Don't take those cheap magnesium pills you can get at any store. Most of them don't get absorbed by the body and act only as a laxative. Magnesium citrate, of which this product is, gets assimilated easily. Don't be surprised if other problems your having begin to clear up as well. Magnesium deficiency can cause a lot of problems.

Whenever he's fixated on something (like another dog while we're on a walk), I quickly wave it near his head to redirect his attention. It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA. It has a May 2, 2014 expiration date printed on the underside of the container.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!"

That's how I know that not all ginger snaps are created equal. Far from it.  Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps really hit the spot with me. They're not over-sweet, and they have a nice, peppery quality -- a lot of snap with your ginger.  They also have bits of candied ginger floating in them, so along with a good crunch (They're not rock-hard like some others I could name, though.)you get little bits of chewiness making the texture very appealing.<br /><br />Normally I'd go on about how there's no HFCS, the sugar and flour are organic, and a bunch of other things related to relative healthiness, but seriously?  I love this cookie, and I don't think I'd care if it did have a lot of crap in it.  No, okay, it would make me unhappy, but not so much so that I'd never eat them again.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with these ginger snaps.

Love because it is very versatile and tasty.  Hate because many times granola is promoted as a healthy food and I have discovered (many times) it is not.  Therefore, I find myself on a pilgrimage to find the best tasting and most healthy granola out there.<br /><br />This brings us to Nature's Path Love Crunch Granola.  This product is a certified organic food with no trans fat and whole grains.  Unfortunately the serving size betrays the calorie count.  So while this product is made with healthy ingredients, the serving size betrays the portions.  Which I find odd because this granola has chocolate and freeze dried raspberries in it.  I have to tell you, I had to dig, no exaggeration for chocolate, excuse me Italian chocolate and raspberries.  Again if there aren't chunks of chocolate (or even raspberries) how is this so high in calories?<br /><br />As for the taste, I must confess that it is pleasant.  Nevertheless, it isn't anything to become too excited over.  I have tasted granola that is half the price that has tasted better.  I have only eaten the granola by itself, I am sure in yogurt, over a salad or ice cream and as a cereal it might elevate the taste.  I will eat this granola, but it will not be something I would attain again.  Under the assumption a person is searching for organic and/or vegetarian granola, you might have found your match.  I for one find organic products, in many cases, as a marketing ploy.  As for finding a great tasting and healthy granola, it still hasn't happened."

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food.

I then decided to switch back to breastfeeding. I had only stopped for about a week, but my milk supply had significantly decreased. I was producing about 2 oz every 3 hours. (My baby has a cleft palate so I exclusively pump. Because of this I am aware of exactly how much milk I am producing.) I ordered the Fenugreek (which arrived surprisingly fast)and started taking it immediately. The bottle suggests taking 1-2 pills 3x a day with food. I started off with that dosage while increasing my pumping sessions. I did not notice a huge difference at first. I read on other message boards that most women take 3 pills 3x a day. I increased my dosage. After about a week of Fenugreek at the higher dosage plus an increase in pumpings, I noticed a huge difference. I would get approx 6oz every 3 hours. My first pump in the morning around 5am I normally get about 10oz! My freezer is now full of milk and my supply has stayed consistent. I now pump for 20 min every 4-5 hours, with an 8 hour break at night. My milk supply has not diminished and I am confident it is the Fenugreek.<br /><br />I have not had any negative reactions or experienced any maple smell that some women have mentioned. I have not experienced any side of that can be attributed to Fenugreek. The only downside is that since I take 9 pills a day the bottle doesn't seem to last very long.

I guess the companies figured we guys were sick of seeing women get special soaps, shampoos, razors, deodorants and skin treatments, and sought to narrow the gap by giving us men something to claim for our own. Give it another decade and there may not be any unisex products in the personal care aisles anymore!<br /><br />And what's to review here? Soap. Fine, fine, fine-- Call it ""Body Wash"" if you want, but that's just the long-hand for ""soap"". Some marketing wizard decided to differentiate soap for your hands from soap meant for the rest of your body (but not your hair) as a means to get us to buy the same product twice. For the record, this soap works on your hands just as well as it works on your butt.<br /><br />It smells nice, like a typical men's deodorant or low-cost cologne. No fruity sweetness here! We're MEN (grunt!) If we can't smell like grease and dirt, then we like to smell like chemicals, not flowers or fruit! So this gets a good grade in the olfactory category.<br /><br />It gets me clean. Dirt was there, and now it's gone. My butt has never been shinier (except for that incident with the oil and the floor buffer). It makes me feel clean too, so I know it's not a mere illusion. LO, I AM NOW APPROACHABLE!<br /><br />Supposedly this soap has long-term effects on my skin, and makes my epidermis more healthy because there are little exfoliating beads in the soap. I'm not sure I can verify that, because I haven't run a long-term test course, but I'll take their word for it. After all, being clean has health benefits in and of itself.<br /><br />There's really no reason to complain about this product. It's a good soap. It comes in a nice squeeze bottle that makes it easy to lather up. It doesn't smell like wet dog or old spinach. It makes me cleaner than I would be if I didn't use soap, and it even works on my hands (despite the conspiracy to get me to buy separate hand soap!) so what else do you want in a soap? Tyler Durden-style lipo fats? A keen chemical burn? You won't get that here!<br /><br />But you will get clean, and you might get some action if you no longer smell like a soiled goat covered in Cheetos dust. That makes it SO worth it."

I read the reviews that this particular kind tastes like leather and is rubbery.  I tried it anyway, since the price is much lower than the other beef jerky types.  My first impression of the medallions is that it is very thin.  It is somewhat rubbery.  It is also very hot. I didn't like it at first, but the taste grew on me.  I actually loved it now.  I would take a scissor and cut the medallions into strips and then slowly taste and savor each one.  The longer I chew, the more flavor I taste.  There is a good portion in the container too."

No, but after moving to the South some 25 years ago, I have tasted lots of iced tea and this one makes as good as you can find anywhere.  I will say that most recipes I could find must have been for some cheap tea bags (weak, somewhat tasteless and bitter), so I experimented a little and found a great recipe for this loose leaf tea.  The recipe is 1/4 cup tea to 8 cups water.  Bring the water to a boil take it off the heat, put the tea in, let it steep for NO MORE THAN 5 minutes and strain into a container, let cool to room temperature and refrigerate.  If you are in a hurry, fill a glass with ice and pour the tea over the ice.  This works great for this particular loose leaf tea - not strong, not weak.  Oh yes, if you like sweet tea, add the sugar to the container while the tea is hot."

I'm about three months in, and have had no failings up to this point. I drink lots of water, and good old H2O is just about perfect. Still, there are some times I want a little more flavor, so I reach for the juice or some Crystal Light packets (the ones that are sized for water bottles). This Vitamin Squeeze product gives me another drink choice that is on the healthy side of the equation.<br /><br />The drink, itself, tastes quite a bit like Crystal Light drinks. So, if you enjoy those, you should enjoy this product as well. The price tag on this product is kind of high, but you do get (supposedly) 24 servings out of this squeeze bottle, as it only takes one squeeze to make a single serving. I have my doubts that it will stretch that far, but we'll see. I could be wrong.<br /><br />I found this product to be fine. It's nothing fantastic, but I wasn't disappointed with it, either.

Both were extra moist and with both I was able to cut back the amount of butter/margarine in the recipes and the flavor didn't really change at all which I think is a good thing.<br /><br />I am a perpetual dieter and one thing I did notice for myself was that when adding this to various foods, I did seem to feel full longer than if I didn't add it. Also, my husband has type II diabetes and this is hasn't spiked his blood sugar because it's got protein and fiber and fiber acts like ""brakes"" for sugar/carbs so they absorb more slowly into the bloodstream and you don't get the blood sugar spikes or at the very least, it doesn't spike so high. So far, despite the holiday season and his ""cheating"" on his diabetic diet, his blood sugar numbers are actually better than this time last year - I'm not giving all the credit for that to this product but I think it's probably helping at least a bit.<br /><br />I just don't see a downside to this product.

I'm not sure how strong hibiscus tea is ""supposed"" to be, but about 10 petals in a coffee mug works for me. The tea produced is very strong and exceptionally sour which, personally, I love. I would say it's similar in taste to rhubarb which I also love. You can add a sugar or sugar alternative if you want, but I say it tastes great straight.<br /><br />I was expecting this to be a finely chopped powder, but as others have said, these are full petals (see my user added image). You don't really need to buy a tea strainer for this. I use a bombilla sometimes,<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141O2IA"">Stainless Steel Spring Bombilla 1 Count</a>, but really, it isn't necessary. Which is convenient for those of us who get lazy. Put petals in coffee mug, pour in water, microwave for 1:30, voila! Just throw away or eat petals when finished. (They have a nice texture to them after they've steeped for a few minutes).<br /><br />Other notes: the tea produced is a very deep and pretty magenta. If it spills on something white, like for example my shirt, it turns into an indigo stain. Would probably be good for and all-natural tie-dye.<br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br />""A study published in the Journal of Human Hypertension has shown that drinking hibiscus tea can reduce high blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes.

Oh, but the FDA does not allow it to be called a ""sweetener"" it has to be labeled a ""nutritional suppliment"" by law so that it can not compete with big money contributers Aspartame (equal) and Sucralose (splenda) and Acesulfame-K so although Stevia is safe and has been used for thousands of years in other countries (even was in Diet Coke in Japan) the only problem the FDA has, is that it can not be called a sweetener!<br /><br />Please don't take my word for anything I have just said above, please do the research yourself so you KNOW it is all the truth."

I've run across many that have had varying degrees of bitterness, usually accompanied by an unnaturally hard consistency, as though they had been harvested too early.  Not these.  They have perfect consistency and flavor.  The vast majority are whole as opposed to halves or smaller pieces.  [Update:  I've now ordered about 8 bags over a period of about a year.  The quality has be consistently excellent.}<br /><br />I use macadamia nuts as a regular part of my diet.  They preferentially reduce bad cholesterol due to their high content of monounsaturated fats.  They are low in carbs, and have very few simple carbs, so they will not only take the edge off your appetite, they will help keep it off.  Unlike most nuts, they are low in oxalate, which means regular use will not increase the risk of kidney stones.  (Pistachios and walnuts are also low in oxalate.)  The only catch is that their high healthy fat content means high calorie count per unit volume.  To dodge that bullet, I just ration them out as opposed to absentmindedly eating from a large container.<br /><br />This is a great product.  I'm happy to give them yet another 5-star review."

It took some getting used to drinking espresso that was not bitter.  I have been using a stovetop espresso maker for 13-14 years.  The difference between correctly made espresso is like night and day.  My taste buds were accustomed to drinking bitter espresso at home.  Now, I am spoiled with this smooth and perfectly-made espresso.  So good, I even drink it without my usual spot of cream and sugar.  Another bonus, is the panarello steam wand.  My kids really enjoy it when I steam a cup of milk for them and then add hot chocolate mix to it.  THey get a kick out of how good the hot chocolate is.  I highly recommend this product.  You could pay more to get a machine built with an exterior of stainless steel, but why bother?  This machine's exterior of plastic is fairly sleek, high-tech looking, and handsome.  It looks good on the counter top.  Before you make yourself an espresso, remember to pour some steaming water into your espresso cup to warm it up.  I find that my espresso cups are on the cool side and tend to make my espressos turn cold rather quickly.  Go ahead and  splurge, this makes a great gift!"

Also, it is louder then the other model.<br />In reply to the other review about how it vibrated and made a VERY loud noise when priming, I experienced the same issue, I called the company about that, and what happens is, you have to lift up the reservoir (which is already filled with water) and set it back down. If it's not setting down just right, it can't siphon in the water, which causes that bad vibration and LOUD noise.<br />It has a really heavy duty cord and just seems really heavy duty.<br />I did see it is around $89.00 at the Keurig website, but saw that after I got this from Staples.

The plastic used for the sifter and trays is slightly more flexible and easier to handle. Sometimes I have to bang the sifter against the inside of our garbage can to dislodge all the clumps, but it generally comes clean quickly.<br /><br />Even our neighbor, who takes care of our cats from time to time, remarked on the ease of cleaning these litter boxes.<br /><br />I like this model so much that I purchased a 2nd one.

You're want specifically named sources of protein like ""chicken"" or ""chicken meal"" and  you do not want things like ""meat byproduct.""  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the ""Holistic""label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become."

467803,B0065G59F4,A26LHX89KA88DG,Gregg,232,235,4,1322524800,Ekobrew Washer Hack,"When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16"" thick, 5/32"" inside diameter, and 3/8"" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493."

Which is to say that these are not ""blanched"" - blanching being the process that removes the actual skin of the almond (not the husk) and leaves a pale buff-colored product. And the description of ""lightly salted"" is accurate. I can barely taste it. The can says the ingredients are almonds, vegetable oil (canola, safflower and/or sunflower) and salt. That's it. Gluten-free. Interestingly enough, there is no indication on either the can or their website whether these are raw or roasted. And I couldn't tell by eating them. But Blue Diamond responded to my email query, saying they are in fact oil roasted - have to be ""Pasteurized"", per a new California law. [You might want to know that this is a ""light"" roasting. I would say that it goes part way to a roasted flavor, remaining as healthy as possible while conforming to the legislation I mentioned. My taste preference is actually for the flavor of a fully roasted almond, bad me.]<br /><br />They taste fresh and almondy, as they should. They make a wonderful addition in both taste and appearance, to my just-created Nonpareil Trail Mix which is lo-carb and gluten-free as I am trying even harder to follow this kind of diet. I'm pleased to report that these Blue Diamond Almonds are properly dated: on the bottom of the can it says ""BEST BEFORE JUL 20 14"". That gives plenty of time to use up six little cans.<br /><br />And about the cans, they seem to be metal bottom and sides, making them superior for storage although the plastic replaceable top with sealed metallic foil under it might be breachable by the ubiquitous rodent. The little cans are nicely reusable."

I keep some fresh, washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes. Just microwave this one, for instance, while cutting up some broccoli, peppers, a carrot, and whatever else I have around (I also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day, cut in little ""twigs"" - delicous!) By the time you're through cutting, you'll have finished with cooking the soup. Take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water, add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl, toss the veggies in the liquid, and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. When through, dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious, healthy meal. The men in my office come snigging around -- several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan. When I am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in, I add a spring onion on top (I just use an office scissors to cut it.)

The flavor is not grassy like some green teas, but very clean.  I don't normally like mint taste in anything other than gum or toothpaste, but this mint is subtle and goes great with the clean taste of the tea.  Besides green tea, the ingredients are spearmint, lemongrass, and peppermint.  Lemongrass is another ingredient that can be overwhelming, but if it's truly in there, I can't taste it.  So as I write this, I am realizing it contains a lot of flavors that shouldn't work for me, but they do!  In fact, I enjoy it so much, I get a little anxious if I let myself run low.

I point this price comparison out to help educate my fellow buyers of this product, seeing that in your local supermarket they're retailing for around $4.49-$4.99 for each 10oz. box containing 2 of the 20 count cookie packages in each. Now that is the same EXACT equivalent as 2 of the 5oz. sleeve packages that I purchased containing 12 boxes per case. Amazon frequently sells the 10oz. boxes in a pack of 12 for around $46-$52.

I mention that because we have noticed that as the coffeemaker ages, the coffee loses flavor.  I guess the coils don't get as hot.  Also, we always shut the coffeemaker off immediately.  Leaving it on, quickly ruins the coffee taste.<br /><br />On the Gevalia Chocolate, the aroma is wonderful, both on opening and during the brewing process.  Creates a nice atmosphere.<br /><br />The first day, we used 7 tablespoons of coffee to 48 ounces of water.  We found the coffee too full bodied for our tastes. The next day we used only 6 tablespoons of coffee to 48 ounces of water.  Though this would seem to make a weak brew, it was very smooth and with a nice flavor.

The first shipment arrived with an added surprise - each box has a Spongebob Squarepants toy inside! Our sons (ages 8 and 7) happily prepare their mother's morning bowl of cereal, knowing each serving gets them one step closer to completing the 8-piece collection.<br /><br />Of course, my wife would eat Chocolate Cheerios with or without the toy. She eats the cereal with 2% milk and a cup of black coffee because, really, you don't need cream or sugar when you're eating a bowl of chocolate cereal.<br /><br />Getting to the basics: the cereal was tightly packaged with no damage; the expiration date extends at least 12 months out, so there's no mad dash to consume six boxes at once; and the price is competitive with the supermarkets we regularly patronize. The added convenience of the cereal arriving at our doorstep rather than hauling it home in shopping bags is a bonus.<br /><br />Personally, I don't touch the stuff. I'm more of a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LV6LQS"">Post Raisin Bran Cereal</a> kind of guy.

Weruva definitely does not have any of that--you can actually eat the dog food and it'll taste just like dinner.<br /><br />Our boy has a sensitive stomach and he's a very picky eater.

I can usually get two decent mug-fulls from two teaspoons of loose tea, making a second cup with the PG Tips did not produce as nearly as robust drink as the first steeping.  I put this down to the fineness of the tea leaves and there being not much left in them for a second cup.  To be honest, a second steeping of PG Tip produced a drink comparable to the standard Lipton tea first steep but when one is expecting the robust flavour of PG Tips, it proves somewhat unsatisfying.

Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream."

Maybe so.,"A friend of mine who is following an alkaline diet recommended Essentia water because of the higher pH level, so I gave it a try. My usual water selection is either filtered water with Brita system or store-brand bottled water (mostly Perrier). I compared the taste of Essentia water with my usual waters and found Essentia to be somewhat silky, but nothing really outstanding. I like the fact, however, that it provides some health benefit by alkalizing the body's pH balance.<br /><br />For those who don't know, alkaline diets emphasize eating fruits and vegetables, along with proper hydration, and are purported to lead to lower rates of cancer and disease. There is also some evidence that it lowers the risk for kidney stones and might slow bone loss and muscle degeneration, increase growth hormones, and even ease low back pain.<br /><br />I researched what is the pH for other popular water and found a test result from a website. I don't know if the small difference in numbers makes big difference in one's body, but since I drink almost a liter of water every day, hopefully there is:<br /><br />Brand: Source or Feature: pH<br />Essentia: Micro-clustered Water: 8.57<br />Aqua Hydrate: Utah purified water with minerals added: 7.96<br />Evian, France: Spring water: 7.53<br />Dasani: Purified tap water: 7.2<br />Volvic: Natural volcanic mineral water: 7.07<br />Arrowhead Spring water: USA Spring Water: 6.83<br />Penta Water: Micro-ionized: 6.7<br />Fiji Water, Fiji: Spring water: 6.65<br />Deer Park, Maryland: Spring Water: 6.31<br />Perrier Water: Processed water with minerals France: 5.28<br /><br />As for Brita pH balance, I found that Brita purposely decreases water hardness to improve the taste of drinking water. As a result, the pH value of Brita filtered water tends to be in the slightly acid range.<br /><br />With the benefit of Essentia water, its reasonable price and convenience, I will most probably switch Brita system to Essentia water."

I have been feeding them Flint River dog food, but the little one is not especially thrilled with it.<br /><br />Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor (made by Purina) is certainly attractive looking. There are irregularly shaped, soft pieces that look like small chunks of meat mixed with smaller, crunchy, green and gold kibble bits. It is not strong smelling. The size of each bit worked well for my smaller and larger dog.<br /><br />Although it looks pretty good to me, my small, picky dog was no more interested in this dog food than the Flint River he usually gets. He ate it, but only after making sure there was nothing better to be had. The larger dog scarfed it down, but then again, she will scarf anything down.<br /><br />Since my lab is elderly and I know nutrition is extremely important, I will be keeping my dogs on the other food because from the ingredients listed on the packaging, it is a higher grade food. (No comparison intended because Flint River is four times the price of Chef Michael's.) However, Chef Michael's seems to me to be an average, middle-of-the-road dog food that is readily available in most stores and has soft bits that many dog's seem to enjoy.

But, y'know, I think this is better than the original Snickers?  A regular Snickers can be throat-searingly sweet  -  the nougat, caramel, and milk chocolate all blend together in one saccharine lump.  Here, though, substituting dark chocolate for milk gives the nougat a grounding  -  lets it stand out as a flavor  -  while the sweet of the nougat makes the dark chocolate more rounded and gives it a taste beyond flat bitterness.  It's as hearty as a regular Snickers, but it has more dimension to it.  It's a shrewd bit of candy engineering.<br /><br />And, let's not forget, the coating is real chocolate, something that's not always guaranteed in today's candy market.  (Tip: if a Hershey's bar says it's ""made WITH chocolate,"" then chocolate's only a partial ingredient  -  in other words, there's not enough actual chocolate in the component to call it chocolate.)<br /><br />Mainstay that it is, I'm not sure I'd call Snickers a five-star candy.  But, y'know, the Dark version made me take a second look at one of the oldest candy bars around and buy two bars in as many days.  It even made me view dark chocolate in a new light.

The first time I cooked the rice macaroni, the pan nearly ran dry of liquid before the macaroni was tender.  But don't worry, it does not come out mushy.

Khannah-Brown""",6,7,5,1291248000,"Real, True Earl Grey Tea, Delicious and Hard to Find","*****<br />If you love bergamot (as I do) then this is your tea. Numi Tea is all high quality, and this aged Earl Grey is no exception. It is a strong, fine tea, and the bergamot is the star. I noticed that it has been mentioned here that the bergamot flavor is too mild; to me, the bergamot flavor is quite prominent, but I don't drink artificially flavored tea, so if you do, this might be a change for you. I love it and would not go back to fake bergamot for anything--real bergamot is a treat and hard to find. Over time, you really don't want anything else and the fake stuff tastes chemically. So if you want to try the real thing, I think you'll love this tea.<br /><br />This tea is certified organic and contains just Organic Assam Black Tea TGFOP Grade 1 (Oxidized Camellia Sinensis) scented with organic Italian Bergamot Fruit (Citrus Bergamia). It is also kosher. On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""Numi's special Earl Grey is oil-free, using a unique method of aging premium Italian bergamot fruit with malty Assam black tea. When brewed, it imparts an exquisite red-orange hue that calls to mind dawn's finest moments. Balanced and stunning, we've recreated this timeless classic.""<br /><br />The price is perfect, a nice savings over single boxes. If you like Earl Grey tea, get it---you won't be sorry.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
4316,B004391DK0,A3DC7VKPGXC1VM,"M. M. OCallaghan ""MickieMo""",2,2,4,1318723200,Very tasty biscuits!,"Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are ""drop ""biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  If you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  I noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  I read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2/3 cups of mix in the box (11 servings of 1/3 cup each).  The biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. I measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and I don't even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  I know this mix doesn't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if I dug into the bag with a cup, I would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  So, there must be a misprint on the box.  I am assuming I measured properly because I have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter & jam, or sliced to make those yummy McDonald's breakfast sandwiches. By following the instructions, I have A LOT of biscuits.  If you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  You will still have plenty and you won't go through the box so quickly.  This mix cost me around $5.00 and I don't have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which I will because these biscuits are really, really good.  Still, if you are watching your budget, don't prepare more than you need.<br /><br />About these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden (because the recipe calls for eggs), and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  Without the eggs, you probably won't get the nice eye-appealing color.  Even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cut-in shortening or margarine. If you don't have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  That is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  It will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  The biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.<br /><br />The mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt, & xanthum gum.  Many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  Bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  It is not grainy at all; I repeat, it is not grainy at all.  For those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldn't be possible with rice flour alone.  Leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  The sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  As for the Xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac-safe baked goods a bit of elasticity (acting as a replacement for the gluten).  You will find Xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  Can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  Sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.<br /><br />The other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  You can find more recipes on their website.<br /><br />I recommend this product for the taste.  I do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price."

For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it."

While it packs a lot of nutrition to start your day, two factors hold it back from being your new go-to item in the morning.  First, the taste is decent, but it works much more as an add-in like granola.  When mixed with yogurt or fruit, it does a great job of adding texture while not overpowering the other flavors.  Second, when you see for yourself how small each bag is, you realize how expensive of a product this is.  So even if you fell in love with the taste, most 99%ers would be hard-pressed to budget a bowl of it each morning.  If you're feeding a family of four, you'd be ordering more just about every other day.<br /><br />Our family was already familiar with the Kind bars and we really like them.  They come with most of the nutrition benefits but neither of the drawbacks that I outlined above.  We'll be sticking with them instead."

Just as I pulled the last weed of the season (October), I felt the earth spin underneath me and I toppled over. Oh boy, did I topple a good one!<br /><br />My neighbor heard me cry out and rushed over. He asked what happened, but I was totally incapacitated. I was on the verge of a coma. He asked me if I had eaten enough... then my husband heard the commotion and shouted out from the TV room ""No--she hasn't had anything all week. She's on a stupid juice cleanse."" I had been on a juice cleanse all week and it had him mad because I'd stopped cooking. He was living off of Nachos and it made him GRUMPY.<br /><br />My neighbor, Jack (he's a little fruity, but we don't mind because he keeps his yard so nice!), said ""well, that's the problem. You need some calories."" At this point I felt like I was about to go into convulsions. My eyes were crossing up into my head and I was drooling. Jack ran to his garage and brought back a Vitamin Water. He opened it and kept saying ""calm down, calm down."" I got very calm. Then I took one sip of that Vitamin Water, and BAM--I was back in business. I jumped up so fast that Jack said ""hey, take it easy!"" I took another drink of the Vitamin Water, and let me tell you I was CURED. I started mowing the lawn immediately.<br /><br />Now I buy the Vitamin Water almost every time I'm at the store. My husband doesn't like the taste, so I took one star off (just to make him happy). But I think it's a pretty great product. I don't know if I would buy 24 my first time.

I was so excited to find the Damask pattern that exactly matched the decorations we chose for my daughter's Sweet 16 Masquerade Ball. Plus I knew I was going to have so much to do, that the sheets seemed the the perfect thing to make a beautiful cake with not much effort. I decided to simply wrap the outside of each tier and pipe a border, place a few fondant masques, and call it a day. Buying that many sheets was expensive, but I thought it would be worth it. The plan seemed to have worked perfectly UNTIL I opened the cake carriers at the banquet hall the next day to do the final stack and pipe the bottom borders. The sheets had evidently absorbed moisture from the buttercream and were all bubbled up and buckled over the entire cake. Any attempt to press them back into place resulted in the sheets sticking to my fingers and shredding away from the cake. Thankfully, the hall was dim and I had made extra fondant masques, so I was able to cover most of the damage. BUT, this was supposed to be the centerpiece of the banquet table! It ended up being relegated to a corner table, so that the worst damage was blocked from view by the wall.

Instead of picking up fast food, I prepare frozen burger patties and fries in the oven. I tried some of this Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce tonight on the burgers and as a dip for the fries instead of the usual ketchup and mustard. It really woke up the taste and made a normally boring meal a little bit special.<br /><br />I don't know which particular thickening agents are responsible for mouth-feel in a dressing, but I tend to dislike whatever Kraft uses in their salad dressings and sauces; they tend to feel almost slimey or gummy (for lack of a better word) on my tongue with a decidedly ""plastic"" (i.e., overly processed/fake-food) taste. (And forget the low-fat versions of anything; I'd rather do without than have to taste those!) I prefer the taste and mouth-feel of Ken's salad dressings (especially the 0-carb Creamy Caesar), so if you are familiar with both of these products, maybe the following will make sense to you:<br /><br />The Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce is a lot closer to the mouth-feel of Ken's than to Kraft, but it still has something in it with a bit of that gummy feel to it. It's not nearly as ""plastic""-tasting, though, and it's quite tasty on hamburgers I think. It's not scorching hot, but it's got a bit of a kick to it. It pairs well with a slice of raw onion. I actually like it better thinned with a little Duke's mayonnaise, but only because that cuts down even more on the slight gumminess.<br /><br />I expect we'll buy more."

Obviously, if you're on a certain medication with known food interactions, you need to be cautious of certain foods. That shouldn't effect how we rate those products for the rest of the world. Medication concerns aside, the drink is very fruity, and refreshing. It is a very nice alternative to plain fruit juice or soda, and far healthier since soda contains no nutrition whatsoever.  This does taste very much like a fresh fruit juice spritzer with authentic flavor, not artificial in any way.  It doesn't have a ""canned"" taste as some fruit drinks in cans do.  I would have liked it to be a tad sweeter, but accomplished that by adding a splash of fresh fruit juice or a flavored syrup such as Torani. The flavor of the product itself is akin to an Italian soda.  I withheld one star because I thought the product straight from the can was a little overly ""fuzzy"" but fares well when poured over ice.  For those trying the pomegranate flavor, be forewarned that this is a ""blend"" including other fruit juices, not straight pom.  The flavor of pomegranate is still plentiful, but not like drinking it straight.  Overall, I think this would make a wonderful addition to the summer picnic cooler or to serve guests at a dinner party. Served in glasses, rather than a can, it would make an impressive dinner beverage to accompany an elegant meal for guests. I would recommend it."

But she had dry skin, a dull coat and not as much energy as a dog her age should have. She also tended to become a bit overweight on it.<br /><br />Based on a recommendation from a corgi breeder & my own research into the premium brands, I decided to try Orijen. What a difference! Her coat is now quite shiny and healthy looking. No more dry skin. Lots of energy, and she has lost a bit of weight & looks more muscular & healthy overall.<br /><br />She also loves the taste - no problem getting her to eat it. But feed according to how your dog looks, not how much it says on the bag. This is high protein stuff & your dog will gain weight if you feed according to package directions. My 25lb corgi (yes, she's a bit on the petite side), gets only 1/2 cup twice a day.<br /><br />No, the initial purchase price is NOT cheap. But because we feed so much less (no grains or fillers), a bag lasts just as long as what we were spending on Eukanuba. FYI - I just got a bag of their 6 fish food to try & she is wild over it."

Trying Mango Diablo from DavidsTea recently has brought back to mind my love of mangos and real mango flavor. I had forgotten it in the face of so much fake-tasting mango flavored tea and candy out there. But I used to beg my mom to let me buy a mango. There are few things better than slicing into a perfectly ripe mango. Makes a royal mess to eat it (at least, the way I did it), but it was so, so worth it. Still, I hate messy food, so if I can find that mango flavor without the mess, I am all for it! It was a bit worried about this tea after the strange bitterness of the Peach and Lemon flavors, but what's life without a few risks? Mango makes me think of summer and tropical smoothies and everything delicious in life.<br /><br />So when I opened it, it had that same smell the Peach and Lemon flavors had, a faint hint of bitterness, and I got worried. Still, never let it be said that I'm afraid to try new things. I made a cup of this to take to work with me, and thank goodness I did, it was a hellish day and I desperately needed the energy from it. But...it wasn't that great. It tasted like decent mango flavor with a back hint of chemicals. I don't know what it is, but I think I just need to stay away from the citrus group of flavored matchas. The Peach redeemed itself when iced, so maybe the mango will do the same. I'm hoping it does. My feelings may also be skewed a bit, I've been spoiled by the delicious goodness of the Mango Diablo from Davids, so my opinions on the mango flavor might have been different if I hadn't been drinking tons of the Mango Diablo lately. That's my new standard for mango flavor and this just doesn't match up to it.<br /><br />Still, it will be no great hardship to finish this off, especially in smoothies over the coming summer months. It's not horrible, it's just not for me. But maybe a lower temperature will help or finding another way to drink it. Or maybe one of my friends will try it and like it and then it will have a good home!"

157627,B0037AKRC6,A128UL0AO1ZPOS,Werner Wolf,1,1,5,1327622400,We really gave them a breathtaking surprise!,"The son is abroad and surprises us with the sudden news that he and his fianc&eacute;e have decided to get married the following week, however, the big celebration will be some months later with all the relatives present, of course. Now what can you do when you're tied in Germany and your kid and his bride walk into Boston townhall to commit themselves to each other? There must be some gesture, some sign of ""We're thinking of you and we wish you all the luck and happiness in the world"". We decided to give this sign with flowers. Now, that's a rather difficult thing to do when donor and recipient are thousands of miles apart. We love giving flowers as a present. What can be more beautiful than a bouquet of fragrant roses? But we'd really like to SEE the flowers ourselves before giving the present to the couple. Well, we solved the problem by ordering 40 Stems of White Spray Roses by SPRING IN THE AIR to be delivered on the morning of the wedding date. And it worked out just fine: the roses were delivered to the house on time, they were absolutely beautiful and fresh (the bride took photos and sent them to us), the couple was delighted, and the bouquet lasted for more than ten days - the couple even took them along on their short honeymoon trip and back home. Thank you for excellent service and super quality. We will certainly use SPRING IN THE AIR again in the future."

I was very pleased to find it in nuggets packed by Reed's.  They're tasty, and I have at least one after each meal, and sometimes one during the night as I have GERD and acid stomach.  There's more info on ginger on the U. of Maryland web site.  I'm so pleased with this product.  I think the difference may be in which form you order.  The nuggets are the consistency of the gummy vitamins for children, but coated with sugar."

I was surprised that they weren't the buttery, dreamy cookies of old. They were OK but not great. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy these again UNLESS they were bargain priced.<br /><br />They are more like a flat, rectangular, adult animal cracker. You know, every once and a while a little BLAH must fall, but not a regular thing for my tastes. I think Nabisco made them a little too heart healthy at the expense of taste."

They've sat in my pantry since then - waiting for me to have time to make a pie. About a week ago I finally did. I opened up the can and tasted a couple. My immediate reaction was ""gross! Somebody mixed in red pepper with the gooseberries!"" I mean the gooseberry flavor was there - but so was the pepper flavor. I buy fresh gooseberries periodically so I know exactly what they should taste like - and this was just completely off. I should have stopped there - but I didn't. I made a pie using the recipe on the label. It turned out completely watery, and the pepper flavor was still there.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer about it. They asked me for the date code on the can. They looked in to it and opened up some cans from about the same time and tested those. They called me back today to essentially say ""hah! They taste fine. You're clearly crazy."" They then told me if I still had an issue with it I should bring it up with Amazon. Unbelievable.<br /><br />As a proud Oregonian, I am embarrassed to have this shady company using my state's name in their business name. Avoid this company and this product.<br /><br />Now I am again in search of a decent source for canned gooseberries. Canned gooseberries that don't taste like they've had pepper added."

Regular gelatin is usually animal-based, and is made from leftover body parts of animals that would otherwise be thrown away. Sound appetizing?

It's really a great way to make your plain water really tasty with low calories, low sugar etc. It's red and the flavor is really good in your bottle of water. The box contains little tubes of product which is supposed to be 2 servings. You just open it and pour the powder in the water. The whole tube is 10 calories. The smaller the water bottle the stronger the flavor which is OK cause it's good. You might want to get a small box at the grocery store and taste it. You are buying 60 little tubes. These are a fantastic replacement for soda. Kids will like it."
